# Software Lifecycle Model  
## Software Process
- A series of steps through which a software product progresses
- Consists of `people`, `overall process`, `intermediate products`, `stages of the process`  
```  
Usual Process Phases :  
Requirements -> Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Maintenance  
```  

## Process Models
### Hacking
아무런 설계 자료나 코멘트 없이, 오로지 코드 중심 개발 `-> 지양!!`  
```  
Hacking focuses attention on implementation details before
- **analysis** : understanding the problem
- **design** : developing a solution
- **objectives** : determining success criteria  
```  

### Waterfall
###### sequential with little feedback
design the system completely, consistently, and unambiguously on the first attempt  
```  
1. write all the program interfaces and internal detatils correctly **on the first attempt**  
2. integrate the system components in **one large step**  
3. do **system testing as the last step**  
```

###### 절대적 절차는 아님. 회사마다 다름.

### Incremental  
###### staged development  
### Evolutionary  
###### exploratory development  
### Spiral  
###### risk management and verification  
### Unified Software Development Process  
###### complex, object-oriented  
### Extreme Programming  
###### light-weight, small and quick
