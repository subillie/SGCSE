## Machine Problem
### [MP1](./MP1/)
1. Problem  
	`Maximum Sum Subrectangle` in a 2D array
2. Goal  
	To understand how different algorithms perform differently while producing the same result for the same problem.
3. Description  
	Find a subrectangle, which has the largest sum

### [MP2](./MP2/)
1. Problem  
	`Master of Sorting`
2. Goal  
	To understand the performance of different sorting algorithms and design your own efficient sorting algorithm.
3. Description  
	Implement four different sorting algorithms.  
	```
	algorithm 1: choose one of the following: insertion sort, bubble sort, or selection sort 
	algorithm 2: quick sort 
	algorithm 3: merge sort 
	algorithm 4: any algorithm or combination of algorithms you think will run fastest 
	```  
	For algorithms 1-3, don’t apply optimization techniques because they are for comparison purposes. For algorithm 4, do your best to optimize the algorithm.  

### [MP3](./MP3/)
1. Problem  
	`Huffman Coding` for File Compression
2. Goal  
	To design and implement a Huffman Coding-based file compression utility program.
3. Description  
	For compression, you are going to use Huffman Coding, which is a greedy algorithm. The goal of the algorithm is to assign long bit strings to rare characters and short bit strings to characters that appear frequently.
