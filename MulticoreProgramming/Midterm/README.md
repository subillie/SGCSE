# 1. ECF - processes
- Exceptions
	- Events that require nonstandard control flow
	- Generated externally (interrupts) or internally (traps and faults)
- Processes
	- At any given time, system has multiple active processes
	- Only one can execute at a time on a single core, though
	- Each process appears to have total control of processor + private memory space

# 2. ECF - signals
# 3. System Level I/O
# 4. Network Programming
