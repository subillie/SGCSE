  INTRODUCTION 

   'To articulate the past historically does not mean to recognize it 'the way it really was' ....  It means to seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger.'  Walter Benjamin, 'Theses on the Philosophy of History', VI, 255 

 'We are confined to ways of describing whatever is described.  Our universe ... consists of these ways rather than of a world or of worlds.'  Nelson Goodman, Ways of Worldmaking, 2-3 

   Artists are the mnemonists of culture.  Their work is memory work, both personal and social, both intellectual and material.  I want to introduce the complexity of this thematics of memory and the ways in which I will discuss it in the chapters that follow with two arresting images, the Toronto painter Sheila Ayearst's Three Minutes (1988; Plate 1) and The Unveiling of the Cornucopia: A Mural Fragment from the Room with the Unknown Function in the Villa dei Misteri of the 1984 Miss General Idea Pavilion by General Idea (1982; Plate 2). 

   The left side of Ayearst's diptych reproduces in painstaking detail, and with close attention to seventeenth-century techniques of glazing, Rembrandt's fragmentary Anatomy Lesson of Dr Joan Deijman of 1656, now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.  Appended and yet opposed to this visual, art-historical recollection are two memorial texts, one inside the other.  The larger, apparently machine-produced text records with the technical, scientific precision of medical terminology the results of an autopsy.  Embedded in a cup-like form within this account is a smaller, much more personal and emotional homage to the death of a brain: 'The brain did not die at once.  It took those three minutes' - an account that, as we will see, is not Ayearst's, but from which she derives her title.  Both texts float on an indistinct surface that is visually reminiscent of the texture of brain tissue. 

   Even this initial description of Three Minutes reveals the complex layering of Ayearst's memory work.  She has recalled an image from art's history that graphically displays the scientific dismemberment of a cadaver as well as textual references to two other deaths.  The brain - the seat of memory, as we commonly think - is pictured in all three instances.  Yet Ayearst's vision demands that we reconsider this habitual 'mentalist' understanding of memory's location, and indeed our resulting relations with the human beings who are defined by it.  Her version of Rembrandt's painting is not as exact as it might appear: she has accentuated the exposed and excavated body cavity of the dead man, making this space as important both optically and thematically as the brain displayed by the surgeon.  She remembers both body and brain - those elements that the Cartesian science evoked by Rembrandt literally takes apart - and considers the two somatically equal in their ability to remember, to record traces.  On the right side of her work, one putatively objective medical appropriation of the brain and its memory similarily vies with the other text, a text that is also written by a doctor of our time and yet is contained in the 'same' skull cap held by the assistant in 'rembrandt's' image.  Crucially, this small text is inscribed in the body of the larger text.  Ayearst's mnemonic devices thus tie the two sides of her piece together; visually, textually, and metaphorically, they tether the seventeenth century's science to that performed in the present while simultaneously offering subversive alternatives to both practices. 

   The rich intricacies of Ayearst's commentaries on memory, the brain, and science are made possible by memory, but not simply her memory.  She relies on Rembrandt's more traditional reflection on Mantegna's Dead Christ (c. 1480), for example, and of the anatomy lessons he witnessed - as well as the doctors' recollections she quotes - and she also depends on her viewer's memories, which might extend from recognitions of art-historical allusions to reminiscences of personal experiences of death to the nature of medical experimentation and documentation in our society.  What Ayearst initiates - but cannot and does not wish to control strictly - with her evocative image and texts is thus neither simply personal nor completely historical.  Her work suggests the overlapping, mutually defining relationship between our everyday notion of memory as individual and history as somehow collective and objective, History with a capital H.  In redefining memory and history in terms of one another, she makes material what Wittgenstein has called a 'memory-reaction' (343), and this reaction or set of reactions animates both her recollections and those of her viewers in the present. 

   With The Unveiling of the Cornucopia, the artists of General Idea invite 'the public to participate in the archaeology of memory' (40).  We see an ersatz ancient mural complete with all the proper art-historical and archaeological signs of its antiquity: faded colour, often imprecise details, visible traces of damage, and, above all, fragmentation.  The central scene, however, is sufficiently intact to arouse our curiosity and to encourage attempts at reconstruction.  Three anthropomorphic poodles seem to be performing some sort of mystery rite around a form that the title suggests is a cornucopia.  The subtitle of this work alerts us to the artists' art-historical allusion to the famous Dionysiac mystery cult imaged on the walls of the Villa of Mysteries at Pompeii c. 50 BC.  But this quotation - like Ayearst's - is only the beginning of a mnemonic reconstitution of meaning.  In a catalogue text entitled Cornucopia accompanying their 1984 retrospective (itself a 'retrospective' event that was projected in much of their earlier work) the artists of General Idea illuminate a project that uncovers the role of memory in their art and in postmodernism generally, a project that begins (not ends, as in much current art-historical identification or appropriation) with our recognition of their allusion: 
  The amorphous world of meanings and functions has traditionally been articulated through the architectural act of construction.  But the three artists of General Idea have re-introduced destruction into the architectural process.  In their long-term project, the 1984 Miss General Idea Pavilion, ruins are created as quickly as rooms are built.  Accumulated layers of function and meaning slip in and out of focus, creating a shifting constellation of images which is the Pavilion itself. (67)  

   Traditional archaeology is based on the assumption that a stable past, a History, can be recovered, but General Idea mocks this possibility and the desire behind it by literalizing the 'shifting' nature of meaning.  What The Unveiling of the Cornucopia uncovers is General Idea's self-created and well-marketed past, a past that here passes for antiquity by deploying culturally specific signs of history: fragmentation and damage.  All the elements in this large mural were indeed pre-constructed precisely to allow for their partial destruction, their cultural weathering, which in turn permits them to signify pastness in an art-historical framework even though they are not literally old.  We see General Idea's signature poodles, their famous ziggurat forms, the cocktail glass spilling its cultural meanings to the left of the central poodle, and of course the cornucopia itself, which never reveals more than the perpetually plentiful process of construction/ destruction through which memory creates meaning.  This image plays in a very telling way with its supposed antecedent at Pompeii: are we not encouraged by the transformation of the Roman wall painting's supposedly Dionysian women into poodles to question the self-serious assigning of meaning that typifies art history's own appropriation of this and all other 'past' images?  The ludic frequently proclaims memory's work, as we will see throughout this book. 

   I suggested at the outset that Three Minutes and The Unveiling of the Cornucopia introduce the central dimensions of memory that I will explore and through which I will elaborate a theory of postmodernism in recent Canadian art.  With the above descriptions in mind, let me specify this promise.  Both works quote from the history of Western art, and this sort of citation is widely held to typify postmodernist practice.  Against the now-fashionable lament - best articulated by Fredric Jameson - that this purportedly fast and loose play with art's history is nothing more than an empty pastiche, symptomatic of a contemporary loss of historical awareness, however, I want to argue that, in many more instances than those in which Jameson and followers like Terry Eagleton can justify their claims (and both authors can be criticized for the abstractness of their arguments, for their unwillingness to offer examples), art-historical recollections are in fact integral to a new concern for the status of history and the past in art.  In 'Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism' (1984) - an article that has rightly become a touchstone in discussions of postmodernism Jameson bemoans what he sees as postmodernism's 'weakening of historicity, both in our relationship to public History and in the new forms of our private temporality' (58).  This loss of the public and personal past, he claims, restricts an individual's 'capacity actively to extend its pro-tensions and re-tensions across the temporal manifold' (71) - in other words, his or her ability to understand the past and to act in a future extending from it.  Jameson's ultimate regret, then, is for what he sees as a loss of social and political efficacy based on a loss of history.  'It is unsurprising' , he has written more recently, in a tone that many critics of the postmodern have adopted without any attention to its local applicability, '... that most of the postmodernisms will betray the extinction of even the protopolitical in their agreeable ironies and their aesthetic cynicisms, their forced accommodation to the system' ('Postmodernism and Utopia', 13). 

   Jameson deploys his arguments about the loss of history in exactly the three areas in which I focalize memory: art's past (his claims about pastiche), the recollective construction of the subject (which for Jameson has lost its sense of past or future time), and social and political recall (where Jameson sees only a cynical quietism).  My counter-claim is that postmodern memory as exemplified by Ayearst, General Idea, and the other artists and pieces in this book can effectively call into question the existence of the 'real History' ('Cultural Logic', 68) on which all of Jameson's arguments covertly depend and for which he is nostalgic in spite of himself.  Memory, with its evanescent yet specific inflections of meaning, is history in a postmodern culture.  As we have seen, in these examples it is not possible to envision a Rembrandt painting, seventeenth-century medical practices, or Roman mystery cults except through the mediating lens of memory.  This is not to suggest that the past doesn't exist, but rather to specify the mode of its existence, the nature of its'reality'.  Since by definition no statement about the past can be confirmed by examining the supposed facts' (Lowenthal, 187), history cannot exist apart from its viewers and their specific and ever-changing perspectives.  The radical implication is that ' nothing is natural about our memories, that the past ... is an artifice' (Terdiman, 19) erected and mediated by the interests of the present.  If we are tempted to defend Jameson by claiming a physical work of art - its status as physical object - as an irrefragable piece of history, an archaeological reminder, we need only think of how The Unveiling of the Cornucopia or Three Minutes augments the possible meanings of its art-historical referents, how each work changes the nature of its antecedent.  Art-historical citation, then, can move beyond the superficial pastiche described by Jameson to a profound, though sometimes simultaneously playful, engagement with the notions of pastness and history in general.  Memory works; it is effective, not cynical. 

   Three Minutes in particular counters Jameson's notion that 'private temporality', in the sense of personal history or the definition through time of what we call a subject or person, is lost in recent art.  What we often see is just the opposite, an extension of this sense of history - sometimes (as in this instance) through a recollection of art, but also in other memories of past events - into the realm of the subject.  Ayearst has brought seventeenth-century experimental science (in what could be argued to be its masculinist invasiveness) into a contemporary perspective precisely by linking Rembrandt's image with recent medical texts.  We are thus asked to contemplate how the subject is construed today, and specifically how memory, mental and/or corporeal, is part of the definition of the subjecthood.  This latter consideration is at once personal and social, since Three Minutes argues for a more inclusive and compassionate construction of the subject than that imaged by Ayearst's Rembrandt.  And if we construe the political very inclusively as that realm of (unequal) power relations among members of society, then Ayearst's memories, in collaboration with those of her viewers, also act politically.  Art-historical citation, for example - as I will argue throughout this book - is never gender-neutral.  It is important politically that Aycarst, a woman, cites a male artist's privileged exposure of the seat of identity in memory and his mirroring of the intrusions of science.  Ayearst stands back from this invasion precisely by quoting it, and she is thus able to insinuate an implicit critique of these cerebral and arguably masculinist practices by embodying the more compassionate small text about the brain's death.

     IV  

  Another difficult argument for the conscriptionists was their linkage of compulsory military training with a "peaceful" Britain.  "Peacefulness" could be interpreted as a promise to protect Britain from the disruptive perils of invasion.  However, the conscriptionist appeal for a peaceful Britain was also based on a rejection of the accusations of militarism and antidemocratic tendencies levelled against them by their opponents.  It is this second definition and the problems which it gave the conscriptionist cause which concern this essay. 

   Just as their critics tried to argue that conscription and economic prosperity did not match, opponents of the conscription movement were quick to equate the scheme with militarism and a break with democratic, peaceful British traditions.  In his book, The Great Illusion, Norman Angell asked poignantly, "Do we not run some danger that with this mania for the imitation of German method we may Germanize England, though never a German soldier land on our soil?" 

   The conscriptionists were extremely sensitive to such accusations.  Lord Roberts was always certain to show that the conscriptionists did not wish to make any violent departure from the traditional English respect for democracy.  In his 1911 book, Fallacies and Facts: An Answer to "Compulsory Service", Roberts admitted that his critics saw compulsory military service as neither constitutional nor English.  To them, it was "an act of violence, an unjust imposition of blood enforced by our seniors on the young men of this country."   

   Roberts also tried to stress that conscription would never be imposed against the will of the working class.  One of Lord Roberts's fondest phrases was that the ballot box had transformed the working classes into the new ruling class, thus making national service their "inalienable privilege" as it was for the aristocratic class of old."   

   The conscription movement also went to great lengths to redefine voluntarism and conscription.  Examples of "peaceful" countries who had adopted conscription were also used with varying levels of effectiveness.  Some conscriptionists came up with unique redefinitions of compulsory and voluntary armies to fit their needs.  In his 1907 pamphlet, National and Non-National Armies, J. Ellis Barker argued that national armies were "composed of the voluntarily united citizens of the whole nation."   

   When searching for foreign examples which presented both a constitutional and democratic version of compulsory service, conscriptionists often gazed towards Switzerland.  The Swiss system of a compulsory militia preserved personal liberties while simultaneously maintaining industrial productivity.   

   As 1914 approached, the conscriptionists sometimes gazed beyond Switzerland to the outer reaches of the empire for inspiration.  In a speech delivered in Bristol on 13 February 1913, Lord Roberts referred to the schemes of universal military training in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa as proof that British political traditions and conscription were not mutually exclusive.  He challenged his listeners to prove that such policies had made any of these dominions "bellicose and aggressive."  Australia held a particular fascination for conscriptionists as its scheme of military training was imposed by a Labour government.  This fact seemed sufficient to Lord Roberts to rebut charges that "civilian armies" would ever be used to put down strikes. 

   Some conscriptionists preferred to look to the British past for precedents.  George Coulton, a medieval historian and conscriptionist, was the leading user of historical examples in support of the movement's goals.  In his booklet, A Strong Army in a Free State, he presented the example of medieval England as a military power with conscription.  According to Coulton, the fourteenth-century army of Edward III was "trained by the completest system of compulsory service organized by a first-rate European nation until modern times."  

   It is interesting to note that few other conscriptionists reached back into the mists of British history.  As previously mentioned, Roberts had harked back to the victories won by the medieval longbow in his appeal for a national system of rifle clubs in the years before becoming president of the National Service League.   However, for the most part, appeals to history were not the main thrust of the major part of the conscriptionists' call to arms.  Few of the conscriptionists could match Coulton's historical knowledge.  Even Coulton was aware that contemporary comparisons might hold more weight with his readers.  In his booklet, A Strong Army in a Free State, only five pages out of fifty deal with detailed historical comparisons.  References to contemporary, democratic Switzerland seemed far more fruitful. 

   How well did the idea of "peacefulness" fit with conscription?  Conscriptionist rhetoric lauding domestic peacefulness and support for democracy starkly contradicts their militarist and antidemocratic image.  Gerald Jordan has noted that the conscriptionists appeared to the British public as "a group of militaristic drum-thumping Colonel Blimps - a pose which certainly since the Boer War, had little appeal for the majority of Englishmen."    For these "socialists" conscription truly was a democratizing force. 

   That being said, it is equally important to note that such views were definitely in the minority.  A majority of both Socialists and British citizens were sufficiently opposed to compulsory military service that it remained an impossible dream for Britain in peacetime.  It was not until the midst of the First World War in January 1916 that the government felt secure enough to introduce legislation to make some form of limited conscription a reality.  It should also be noted that as a popular slogan "peacefulness" could only go so far in selling conscription.  The best popular response came by appealing to public fears over invasion.  When such appeals were made, peacefulness faded far into the background. 

   V  

   The conscription movement was not one for ideological sophisticates.  Lord Roberts and his followers tried earnestly to convert British opinion to the need for conscription but were usually outclassed by their more agile opponents.   Faced with such difficulties, the temptation existed to appeal to the public's base fears about invasion.  The fear of invasion was indisputably the trump card of the conscription movement.  Although conscriptionists tried to tie their scheme to notions of health, prosperity, and "peacefulness," their strongest public response came from graphically portraying the threat that invasion represented. 

   The National Service League supported books like William Le Queux's Invasion of 1910 (1906) and even sponsored their own play, B.S. Townroe's A Nation in Arms (1990).   Invasion could be seen as an immediate threat and compulsory military training could be presented as simply the most effective form of home defence.  Such straightforward arguments reached their peak between 1908-9 and retained some force until 1914 though complicated by the presence of a new voluntary home defence unit - the Territorial Force. 

   Although the conscriptionists relied heavily on invasion rhetoric, especially in their later years, it is necessary to go beyond this well-known side to the movement.  Conscriptionists had other arguments.  The important point is that they tried to use them at all.  It is only by assessing the full scope of arguments of the conscription movement that its place in Edwardian Britain can be full appreciated and evaluated.  </I

   Chapter 2: 
  'The Canadian Mosaic: A Melting Pot on Ice': The Ironies of Ethnicity and Race 

   I enter here upon the general area of ethnicity and race  Yet, just as even the English and French were once immigrants to Canada, so too are they 'ethnic', at least insofar as they possess distinctive cultural customs and languages.  If you don't consider the British as 'ethnic', think about cricket and Yorkshire pudding. 

   Theorists of ethnicity have also made the distinction between ethnicity as the lived experience of 'otherness', and ethnicity as 'governed, packaged, marketed, and consumed' - in Canada, as multiculturalism.  artists to signal that resistance - perhaps even that celebration.  In his poem 'Canadese' (Italian for 'Canadian'), Antonino Mazza uses this kind of irony with a certain deconstructive, critical power: 
 Because life for him
has been labour and struggle, Canadese, remember your father.
Don't try to reject your mother tongue, in our cage, it is wrong;
do canaries smother their private song?
Be patient, don't rage, Canadese, in time we'll belong;
we'll acquire our own sense of this land;
we'll record life and death of our million births; 
we'll have families, above and below the earth.
Canadese, you must never forget
what you are .. never!
because, when you do, they'll remind you.  

   The addressee of this poem - the 'you' - is specifically Italian Canadian, and so my response here is likely different from most readers'.  The ethnicity of the implied reader is an issue not often addressed in studies of ethnic writing, yet the 'we / they' doubleness, which the irony of this poem foregrounds, is as much the basis of the politics of resistance as the source of the alienation of otherness.  And doubleness - of identity, of culture, of loyalties, often of language - is the basis of the experience of immigration in general, for anyone, anywhere.  But in Canada it continues to define the experience of those of any 'different' ethnicity and race - different from the English and French white dominants.  Of course, what for a writer can be a 'pleasure', however perverse (or ironic), can often yield pain for others.  Yet, as I suggested in the last chapter, in this age of the postmodern re-valuing of borders and margins as preferred sites of articulation of difference, many feel that the margins are indeed where the action is: that resistance and contestation make for more exciting art than centrisms of all kinds (ethno-, phallo-, hetero-, and so on).  The fact that, in the day-to-day life of either immigrants or Canadians of 'different' race or ethnicity, that marginalization may not be so valued, or so liberating, does not mean that irony cannot still be an effective tool for articulating both marginalization and the challenges to it. 

   In an important early essay on the 'ethnic voice' in Canadian writing, Eli Mandel noted that doubleness, even 'duplicity', was what all immigrants live and grapple with daily (p. 265).  The literature that comes out of this experience itself exists at 'the interface of two cultures': 'a form concerned to define itself, its voice, in the dialectic of self and other and the duplicities of self-creation, transformation, and identities' (p. 274).  I have been suggesting that irony is one way of coming to terms with this kind of duplicity, for it is the trope that incarnates doubleness, and it does so in ways that are particularly useful to the 'other': irony allows 'the other' to address the dominant culture from within that culture's own set of values and modes of understanding, without being co-opted by it and without sacrificing the right to dissent, contradict, and resist. 

   The need to retain this right is especially clear in the work of those writers who belong to, in the latest terminology, 'visible minorities'.  Perhaps this has a lot to do with the discrimination that they feel, even within what we like to think of as liberal Canada.  Arun Mukherjee has argued that South Asian writers 'may be said to possess that double vision which comes only with alienation from the dominant group'.  This is the double vision that is a fruitful breeding ground for ironies, ironies that voice the contradictions that the outsider can see, even within a seemingly homogeneous culture.  Mukherjee feels that one of the most important roles of literature by ethnic and racial minorities in Canada can be to make the dominant and dominating culture self-conscious (p.95). 

   This too - perhaps intensified - is the role of women writers within these minorities.  As many feminist scholars have noted, ethnic women are doubly marked as outsiders: as female and as racially or ethnically 'other'.  In other words, the basic trope underlying their subversion and resistance, once again, is irony: saying one thing, meaning another.  Often the politicized challenges of works considered feminist, then, are also challenges to 'centred' or '-centric' notions not only of ethnicity and race, but also of class and, in Canada, of geographic and social region. 

   A good example would be the multiple ironies of Lola Lemire Tostevin's poem about her Northern Ontario roots.  It opens with an address to 'general' (Canadian?) readers.  For these, she says, 'the people from my old home town wouldn't be considered / Real People'.  They would not recognize them from their experience of either life or art: 'they wouldn't just walk off the page / to remind you of a mother or a neighbor.'  The ironies are double-directed here, as readers are told that none of them 'would comfortably find a place' here.  The tone of the narration, from here on, is the familiar one of ironic naivete, of the poet's persona as a child growing up in this town as a Franco-Ontarian, Catholic girl who is trying to understand her social environment.  For instance, she once heard the word 'cathouse' applied to one of the places in town.  So first she 'watched for cats'.  When this yielded little, she looked up 'cathouse' in the dictionary, where she found all sorts of 'cat words' - except 'cathouse'.  Among her alphabetical list of these 'cat words' is embedded this satiric, ironic thrust: 'catgut cat hook / I was stunned to learn that catholic was defined as universe-/ al and broad in sympathies and interests.' 

   A Franco-Ontarian writer - like a native, Metis, or Acadian one - is 'other' in Canada, in a way that a Quebecois can probably never be, given Quebec's history and institutions, which have increasingly effectively worked to protect that particular historically francophone part of Canadian culture.  However, whether the culture be Quebecois, English Canadian, or that of almost any ethnic group, one shared attribute reappears consistently: they are all usually portrayed as pronouncedly patriarchal, and this explains in part why the feminist and ethnic resistances often dovetail.  As Myrna Kostash has put it, reacting against the notion that there is no need to attack female oppression (or ethnic discrimination) because these are obvious concerns of 'human' liberation: 
 Well, I think that has been exposed by some feminists for the liberal fantasy it is, and as an ethnic, I feel much the same.  I'm not 'just' a Canadian; I think there is an obligation among the oppressed minorities and oppressed groups in this country to redefine themselves from their own experience, with their own purpose in mind and not be misled by the liberal fantasies of the dominant culture.  

   For immigrants, the need to resist that dominant culture - however liberal or well-meaning - may be intensified because of the weight of cultural tradition, made heavier (not lighter) by distance and time, by memory, by a sense of exile or simple nostalgia.  Therefore the drive towards self-definition within a new culture may well involve separation from this ethnic past, at least temporarily.  And irony is a useful device for articulating both the pull of that tradition and the need to contest it.  It is also a way to challenge ethnic stereotyping.  Here is Len Gasparini writing to Pier Giorgio di Cicco, a fellow Italian Canadian poet: 
 Let us string our mandolins and sing 
O Sole Mio every night.
The joy is ours.
Strangled by a spaghetti stereotype, 
an Italian is supposed to lay bricks. 
You build poems with the stars.  

   I mentioned earlier that what we currently call postmodernism has entailed a re-valuing of difference in culture: difference in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexual preference.  The 'ex-centric' or off-centre is valued over the centre.  The postmodern distrust of centres and the hierarchies they imply can be seen in many ways: in the recoding of the (denigrated) notion of regionalism into the positive concepts of the local and specific; in the focusing of attention on the periphery rather than the metropolis; and in the general interest in diversity, in the different rather than the same.  Part of this is simply an inversion of pre-existing hierarchies,since all binaries indeed conceal hierarchies, as Jacques Derrida has taught us.  Poststructuralist thought like his has also suggested that all meaning is created by differences and is sustained by reference to other meaning.  So, while this equally binary inversion operates as a powerful challenge to the established power of centres (of economic, political, social, and cultural power), the postmodern also tries to go beyond this and to rethink binary oppositions completely in terms of the multiple, the plural, and the heterogeneous: 'and / also' thinking replaces 'either / or'. 

   For literary and cultural studies, the end result of this postmodern reassessment has been a new cultivation of cultural difference as positively valued diversity and plurality.  A good example of this kind of rethinking in the area of ethnicity is Werner Sollors's book Beyond Ethnicity: Consent and Descent in American Culture,  One of the reasons for irony's key position in postmodernism, however, is that excentricity is what in fact defines the postmodern, and resistance to a dominant (from within) is part of that definition.  Lipsitz points out that, since ethnic and racial minorities can neither assimilate nor separate completely from the dominant culture, they are forced into 'complex and creative cultural negotiations' with and against that dominant force, negotiations that involve confronting it with their own history and traditions.  Lipsitz even goes so far as to make the doubleness or 'bifocality' of the ethnic vision the paradigm for 'the decentered and fragmented nature of contemporary experience'.  In other words, ethnic (and presumably racial) minorities are paradoxically both marginal and typical: 'Masters of irony in an ironic world, they often understand that their marginality makes them more appropriate spokespersons for society than mainstream groups unable to fathom or address the causes of their alienation.'  Perhaps.  But this kind of logic denies the specific kind of doubleness of the ethnic vision; it risks ignoring the doubled alienation that particular vision may represent in an already alienated and alienating world.  </I

    PART ONE 
  THE ERA OF EDIFICATION 

   In the era of Victoria and Edward, magazines were seen and saw themselves as instruments of moral and pedagogic improvement.  Man was perfectible, and the periodicals he read would help perfect him.  In the view of George Stewart, a magazine "is a great national university, diffused, without loss of effectiveness, throughout an entire nation." 

   At first the national status of magazines was doubtful.  Writing in 1868, Henry James Morgan defended his listing of newspaper editors and writers in his Bibliotheca Canadensis by saying, "In our young country ... our principal newspapers may be considered as holding no unimportant position in Literature.  We have not many periodicals of a purely literary kind; and the morning journal may be said to be as much a literary as it is a political organ ....  Besides, the majority of our journalists have been men of superior education and literary culture, who have themselves written works and pamphlets.  A very distinguished author has recently remarked 'that a hundred years hence the newspaper will be the only possible book.' " 

   In the short or even long term the distinguished author was proven wrong, but his prediction was not wildly unfounded.  The nineteenth-century line between newspapers and magazines was blurred.  Newspapers published much poetry and fiction, but usually left cartoons to magazines.  Egerton Ryerson's Christian Guardian, the most important church paper before Confederation, resembled a magazine in some respects and was in fact the forerunner of the United Church's New Outlook and Observer .  Canadian Illustrated News and Grip regarded themselves as weekly papers, and Saturday Night began as one. 

   Yet magazines, not books or newspapers, would emerge as the national medium.  Magazines were advertised and reviewed as if they were books, and, for the writers of books, magazines were an indispensable bridge to their public.  After or during a newspaper apprenticeship, most fiction writers began by contributing stories to magazines - for copyright reasons these were usually British or U.S. magazines and continued to produce short stories and serials while appearing between hard covers. 

   The causes for magazines' prominence were relatively simple.  Newspapers, confined to cities and towns and often blindly partisan, could not present a judicious national overview.  Books lacked the magazine's continuity, usually only presented one writer at a time and were beset by confused copyrights and unsatisfactory economies of scale.  With its built-in advantages, a magazine could be all things to all Canadians. 

   "All" is used advisedly.  The founders and editors of magazines were class conscious, although the class consisted not of the aristocracy, but of those who, through diligence and intrinsic moral worth, proved themselves eligible for membership in an elite.  The magazine's "mission," said George Stewart, "is to stimulate and afford expression to the higher thought and tastes of a people, to bring the country's best thought, under the most favourable circumstances and in the most attractive form, before the best classes of the country's readers - the classes upon whom the shaping of the political, social, intellectual and even industrial future of the nation most largely depend." 

   Stewart and his colleagues seemed to presuppose these natural leaders ensconced in armchairs, puffing pipes and nodding gravely or smiling gently in approval.  For Stewart a good magazine is "reserved for the quietest half hours of comfortable leisure, when the mind is in the most receptive mood and most ready to respond to facts and arguments attractively and candidly presented, or to the quiet touches of beauty, humour, pathos that lighter literature furnishes...." 

   Ribaldry was not part of the lighter touch; even humour had its moral applications.  Which is not to say that the Victorians were humorless.  Besides Grip, their comic journals included Punch in Canada  - founded in 1848 in Montreal, it was the first to run regular political cartoons - , Diogenes, Grinchuckle, The Grumbler and, in the Edwardian period, Knox McGee's Moon.  Describing the struggle between the sacred and secular and how they might be reconciled was a constant in the higher-minded magazines, especially those published by the churches but also in the popular press.  It was the age, after all, of Origin of Species, and the clergymen sometimes had to end in arguing that evolution itself was part of God's ongoing design.  The relationship between science and theology was tirelessly examined and, only slightly less so, the gap between rich and poor.  The latter was linked to the search for utopian panaceas like Henry George's Single Tax, and not just in J. W. Bengough's Single-minded Grip.  As W. J. Rattray noted in Belford's Monthly in May 1878, "Whatever sins of omission or commission may be fairly laid to the charge of our age and generation, indifference to the momentous problems of human life and destiny is not one of them ....  Men are far too seriously-minded in their search after truth...to treat the solemn questions which persistently obtrude themselves for solution on every age, with levity, scorn or a flippant superficiality." 

   In creating this edifying spectacle, the influence of the Scots Presbyterians, those relentless educators of themselves and others, cannot be overstated.  With the merger of its sects in 1875, the Presbyterian church was until 1925 the largest Protestant denomination.  Many if not most of the printers, publishers and editors were Scots and had all the characteristics of that enterprising, argumentative race.  As Elizabeth Waterston has pointed out, Scotland created a battalion of literary exemplars: Robert Burns for lyric poets, Sir Walter Scott for historical romancers, Macaulay and Carlyle for the writers of "Great Man" and thesis history, Robert Louis Stevenson for those who wrote adventure stories for children, J. M. Barrie for those, like Ralph Connor and L. M. Montgomery, who limned regional idylls. 

   Literary taste tended to be conservative.  Some editors like Graeme Mercer Adam deplored "the intellectual vivisection methods" of Henry James and W.D. Howells and "the loathsome realism and putridity" of Emile Zola and Anatole France.  As Claude Bissell says in the Literary History of Canada, in poetry the Canadian critic and writer disliked "technical experimentation, the intellectual, any suggestion of the commonplace and the realistic."  Desired "were elegance of diction, nobility of sentiment, and clarity and picturesqueness of observation." 

   Despite the bows made to poetry and fiction, what the editors took most seriously was intellectual debate.  The great issues - the conflicting claims of science and religion, the overriding question of whether Canada would meld, even merge with the United States - were endlessly debated.  In retrospect, free traders and protectionists, annexationists and imperialists all seem utopians.  The free traders and annexationists imagined that a north-south flow would produce nothing but prosperity.  The imperialists supposed not just that their country would have a magnificent future, but that it would become a partner or even leader in an ever more glorious British Empire. 

   One debate was about how magazines themselves would take form.  The imperialist (and future knight) J.G. Bourinot, for many years the clerk of the House of Commons and a frequent contributor to periodicals, wrote that

  No doubt there is room in the Dominion for a magazine combining the features of 'Blackwood,' the 'Contemporary' and the 'Quarterly Review'; that is to say, poetry, fiction, criticism, reviews of topics of the day, and in fact, original literary effort of the higher order, which, though mostly ephemeral in its character, must have much influence for the time being on the culture and the education of the public mind ... if such a venture is to succeed hereafter it must have behind it sufficient capital to engage the assistance of the best Canadian writers, who now send their work to American and British periodicals.  Such a magazine must be carefully edited, and not made the dumping-ground for the crude efforts of literary dabblers or for romantic gush and twaddle ....  

   That Bourinot, an expert on constitutional history, could comment authoritatively on literary matters was typical.  Victorians could comment authoritatively on anything.  They were not narrow specialists, but took the world's mind and actions for their domain.  Literature was not just poetry, fiction and belles lettres, but anything in which verbal analysis and narrative held sway.  Limited as their aesthetic conceptions may have been, they did see humanity as a whole, and the best magazines they founded and wrote for had the same consonance and comprehensiveness. 

  Pre-Confederation Clusters 

   If the magazines prior to Confederation were usually short-lived, at least there were a lot of them.  Solemnly conceived, desperately hopeful, they were pioneering and they knew it.  The age of advertising had yet to arrive, and they relied on pitifully few subscribers.  To a modern reader it is a confusing world of innumerable titular changes and contributors who were anonymous, pseudonymous or hidden behind initials.  Colonial, these magazines heavily reprinted material from Britain and the United States, at the same time as they were tracing the faint outlines of a new culture. 

   Magazines in what is now Canada were not spontaneously generated by Confederation.  If Confederation marked the birth of a big nation it also tolled the death of little ones.  The eastern British North American colonies were, after all, embryonic independent nations, and ones whose periodicals aspired to serve self-contained publics. 

   The first magazine to appear in British North America was Halifax's Nova Scotia Magazine and Comprehensive Review of Literature, Politics and News (1789-92).  It reached 200 subscribers - including judges, surgeons and the Bishop of Nova Scotia - and was printed on a wooden screw press by John Howe, father of the famous Joseph, who also sold it over the counter of his office (eighteenth- and nineteenth-century bookshops were often run in conjunction with a press and journal).  Edited by the Reverend William Cochran, the magazine had some local content, though much of it was reprints.  There then followed in the Maritimes such initiatives as the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick or Historical, Literary, Theological and Miscellaneous Repository; Acadian Magazine and Literary Mirror; New Brunswick Religious and Literary Journal; The Pearl; Halifax Monthly Magazine; and Nova Scotia New Monthly Magazine.  Most had varying titles and were located in Halifax or Saint John.  None lasted more than two years. 

   The most interesting of these, because of the people behind them, were Mayflower, or Ladies Acadian Newspaper (1851-2) and Provincial, or Halifax Monthly (1852-53).  Mary Eliza Herbert, the nineteen-year-old daughter of an immigrant Irish blacking manufacturer, published The Mayflower as a thirty-two-page publication in May 1851, seeking readers in those wishing "to roam a while in the flowery fields of romance - to hold communion with the Muses."  As the first female editor of a magazine in British North America, Herbert narrowly beat out Mary Jane Lawson nee Katzmann.  At twenty-four, Katzmann, the poetical daughter of a German and his New England wife, became the Provincial's editor.  Aiming for a wider audience - male as well as female - she drew more from regional writers than had Herbert and had higher cultural and social ambitions for her audience. 

   In Quebec the first magazine had been started in 1792, the bilingual Quebec Magazine (Magasin de Quebec; ou, Recueil utile et amusant de Litterature, histoire, politique, etc., particulierement adapte a l'usage de l'Amerique.   In its less than two years of life the Quebec City periodical was edited by Alexander Spark on the press of the Neilson family, prominent in Quebec printing for the next half-century or more. 

   In the Canadas, magazines trailed, doglike, the growth of population, though the potential audience was always small.  In the 1840s, the market for a Toronto periodical might extend east to Montreal and south to New York State, but was mainly confined to the province's half-million widely dispersed inhabitants.  The later distinctions among farm, church and literary magazines were smudged.  Agricultural papers were the first family magazines, and the Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist church journals often had literary content.  Still, there were certain fast divisions between country and town.  Those who aspired to gentility might turn to magazines with titles like the Canadian Gem and Family Visitor; the more practical-minded might opt for the Canadian Agricultural Journal (Montreal, 1848-68). 

   Whatever the magazine's tack, the power inherent in the press had come permanently, if at first precariously, to reside along the Great Lakes and the southern edge of the Laurentian Shield. 

   In Montreal, the foremost city, Samuel Hull Wilcocke ("Lewis Luke MacCulloh, Esquire") edited the iconoclastic The Scribbler: A Series of Weekly Essays on Literary, Critical, Satirical, Moral, and Local Subjects, interspersed with pieses of Poetry (1822-27), which shifted to nearby Rouses Point in Vermont after its first year.  In Montreal, Nahum Mower printed the monthly Canadian Magazine and Literary Repository (1823-25), which amounted to four volumes of almost six hundred pages each, and David Chisholme, a Scot, edited the quarterly Canadian Review and Literary and Historical Journal (1824-26), which published "The Rising Village" by Oliver Goldsmith, grand-nephew of the playwright and novelist who had been Dr. Johnson's friend.  

   In Upper Canada, where John Strachan attempted the Christian Examiner (1819-20), the first illustrated periodical was the Canadian Literary Magazine (1833).  Published by George Gurnett in York (Toronto), each issue had an engraved portrait, "the first we believe," said the editor, " ... ever engraved in Upper Canada - engraved too on Canadian stone, and from thence, by means of a Canadian press, transferred to Canadian paper." 

   Counting both Canadas, before 1850 there were magazines in Montreal, York, Kingston, Brockville, Cobourg and Hamilton.  From a literary viewpoint, the most important was the literary Garland (1835-51) in Montreal, published by John Lovell and edited by his brother-in-law John Gibson.  Whichever literati the Canadas possessed were published in the Garland: John Richardson, Charles Sangster, Rosanna Leprohon, Anna Jameson, Catherine Parr Traill and her sister, Susanna Moodie.  The Belleville wife of the former Endlish officer and ne'er-do-well farmer Dunbar Moodie, Susanna even edited a magazine herself, rather pathetically entitled Victoria Magazine: A Cheap Periodical for the Canadian People (1847-48), and contributed serialized excerpts from novels, poems, even a song to the Garland (the first magazine to regularly publish musical scores).  In its second year, it began to publish lithographs of landscapes, children and well-dressed citizens, with tissue-paper overlays to preserve the pictures for framing, though these expensive trappings were dropped in 1849 for reasons of economy.

  THE LONG GESTATION: 
  1837-1937 

   It is well known that mercantilist France did not permit the setting up of printing presses in its colony, New France, insisting that all publications of whatever kind be published in Paris.  Nevertheless much writing in a variety of genres was inspired by contacts with Canada and its aboriginal inhabitants, and some of these were printed soon after completion, while others had to wait for years or even decades.  Among the writings of New France were accounts of their voyages by Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain, those of explorers Jolliet and d'Iberville, the annual Jesuit missionaries' reports to their superiors in the mother country issued under the name Relations (1632-1672), detailed ethnographic descriptions of Amerindian life by Sagard and more fanciful ones by LaHontan, the massive correspondence of Marie de l'Incarnation and that of Elisabeth Begon, the annals of the Hotel-Dieu de Montreal by Marie Morin, Pierre Boucher's inventory of the colony's resources, and historical accounts by Lescarbot, Dollier de Casson, and Charlevoix.  Cartier's texts are believed to have influenced the subsequent literary production of Rabelais and Montaigne.  

   No novels emerged during the French regime.  This genre had its beginnings in France as early as the sixteenth century, yet it would be some three hundred years before it made its appearance in French Canada.  As for reading fiction, the Catholic clergy, whose power actually increased following the British Conquest, lost no time in denouncing such 'dangerous' books.  As early as 1771, for example, Mgr Briand, Bishop of Quebec, urged his parishioners to 'stop reading those impious works that are spreading through the diocese.'  In the 1840s, Bishop Bourget of Montreal led a campaign against 'the reading of immoral novels', and in Chauveau's Charles Guerin (1853) there is a reference to an auto-da-fe that nearly destroyed the entire library of M. Guerin senior, and may have been based on fact.  In the postscript to another novel, published in serial form in 1846, Patrice Lacombe's La Terre paternelle, we read: 'Let's leave their blood-soaked novels to the old countries spoiled by civilization, and paint the child of the land the way he really is ...'  When Quebec novelists did begin to publish in the nineteenth century, they would write a preface denouncing their very genre, or disclaim their work's fictional nature.  Antoine Gerin-Lajoie writes about his Jean Rivard (1862, 1864): 'This is not a novel ...', and a critic claimed that this influential work was a 'faithful sketch of ... a young Canadian pioneer ...' Jules-Paul Tardivel, in his futuristic Pour la patrie (1895)/ For My Country, prefaced the book by noting that 'the modern novel, and especially the French novel ... seems to be an arm forged by Satan to destroy the human race.'  Rejean Beaudoin has said that the call in 1861 by the leading literary ideologue, abbe Henri-Raymond Casgrain, for writers to draw on legends as major sources for literary creativity was a tactic for turning authors away from writing novels: 'One of the essential functions of the legend seems to have been to build a dike against the popularity of the modern novel ... French-Canadian writers were urged to emulate the simplicity and purity of folk imagery, that direct reflection of the beauty of traditional folkways.'  In 1866 Casgrain traced the main lines of a national and religious literature, which, he said, would be 'chaste and pure like the virginal mantle of our long winters ...  It will have none of the masks of modern realism, that manifestation of impious and materialist thought.' 

   These factors explain the slow emergence of the novel form in Quebec, as well as the fact that the first novelist, the twenty-three-year-old Philippe Aubert de Gaspe fils  (1814-41), and his more famous father - who, it is believed, authored parts of his son's novel, L'Influence d'un livre (1837), as well as his own classic, Les Anciens Canadiens (1863) - both made ample use of legends in these two works.  In fact, in both the central plot is interrupted by the insertion of legends and songs drawn from folk traditions.  Andre Senecal has rightly stressed that from a generic point of view L'Influence d'un livre is nothing more than the outline of a novel. 

   Three narrative elements intertwine in this primitive text: the story of the search of an impoverished alchemist, Charles Amand, for the philosopher's stone that will make him rich, inspired by the manual of Albert le Petit; the murder of the peddler Guillemette by the hideous Lepage; and the romance between Eugene Saint-Ceran and Amand's daughter, Amelie, which ends happily when the former graduates as a doctor and is able to bribe the previously obstinate father to consent to the marriage.  The murder, and the story of Amand's search for the elusive formula for gold, were both based on real people and events in the Saint-Jean-Port-Joli region south-east of Quebec City.  

   According to Andre Senecal, this Gothic work achieves some unity 'at the level of its moral discourse'.  He sees de Gaspe, the son of a penurious aristocrat, reflecting the unease of his social stratum before the growing materialism of an emergent capitalism, but not without ambiguity.  Thus, for Senecal, what ties this loose work together is the thirst for gold.  Indeed, in addition to Amand, who dreams of gilded treasure, there is Lepage, who kills for a pittance, and the central figure of a folk legend, Rose Latulipe, who, enticed by luxury, abandons her fiance for an elegant gentleman (the devil in disguise).  According to the misogynist Saint-Ceran, the author's alter ego, women, those 'merchants of emotions', learn to flaunt their charms 'before those who have gold ... even if they are degenerates'.  Yet, having made money himself while seemingly condemning an acquisitive society, he says of his future father-in-law: 'He must be as poor as a churchmouse.  I'll offer him some money and he won't be able to resist', thus preparing the 'purchase' of his betrothed. 

   Unfortunately the version of L'Influence d'un livre that most Quebec readers would know was that of the 'edited' second edition of 1864, which was revised by Casgrain and reprinted several times subsequently, with the good abbe, holder of the copyright, making a tidy sum, especially from the school market for which he was responsible.  The 1968 edition, the first since 1885, is a facsimile copy of Casgrain's expurgated text, in which the rather mild erotic references and the host of quotes of authors who, since the original edition, had incurred the wrath of the Church, were unceremoniously removed.  The title was also changed to give less weight to the alchemist's manual, and now became Le Chercheur de tresors ou L'Influence d'un livre.  (Andre Senecal's edition of 1984 is the first to reproduce the original text and title.) 

   The imitative Gothic form represented the first phase of the emergence of the novel genre in French Canada.  By the mid-1840s it gave way to the roman de la fidelite, which would be dominant for about a hundred years.  This principal mode imposed on writers the task of inspiring readers to safeguard the French language, and the customs, traditions, and faith of the French-Canadian nationality in accordance with the ideological drive for survival (survivance).  Its main branch was the roman du terroir - the novel of the land.  The other branch, the historical novel, would appear later in the nineteenth century and also have a long life.  Its main thrust, as we shall see, was to turn its gaze backwards to the 'glories' of the French regime. 

   The roman du terroir was inaugurated by La Terre paternelle (1846), a short novel by Patrice Lacombe (1807-63), which preached the superior values of the agricultural vocation over life in the cities and in the lumber camps or in the fur trade.  Chauvin pere deeds his land to his eldest son, who mismanages it; he then takes it back, rents it to Anglos, fails in business, loses his farm and is forced to lead a poverty-stricken existence, with his son, in Montreal.  Salvation comes, however, from a formerly wayward younger son who had escaped to the pays d'en haut (the fur-trading areas upstream on the Ottawa River) and now returns with money enough to buy back the farm, la terre paternelle. 

   Both here and in Charles Guerin: Roman de moeurs canadiennes (1853), by P.-J.-O. Chauveau (1820-90), an inherited patrimony is in danger of falling into the hands of the etrangers - the Anglais, clearly named in Lacombe's work and referred to in a veiled way in Charles Guerin  It is the story of a family, headed by the widow Guerin, that nearly loses its property in the St Lawrence valley, owing to the schemes of Wagnaer, a Protestant from Guernsey, and his (Balzacian) corrupt lawyer.  Their plot is thwarted by the return of one of the sons, Pierre, from Europe.  He retrieves the heritage (as in La Terre paternelle) and creates an agricultural-industrial enterprise to keep young people from emigrating.  Chauveau and Lacombe were the first novelists to transcribe phonetically many characteristic traits of Quebecois popular speech (unfortunately, regional vocabulary was set off by italics) and to introduce genre scenes of typical Quebec rural life that would be imitated in the years to come.  

   Like Charles Guerin, the two-volume Jean Rivard (1862, 1864) by Antoine Gerin-Lajoie (1824-82), aimed to stop the mass exodus of French Canadians to the industrial towns of New England by urging settlement in as yet uninhabited regions of Quebec.  Similarly to its predecessors but on a much larger scale, this epic 'novel' projected the establishment of networks of agricultural centres with seasonal, farm-related industries as an antidote to emigration and to the surplus of the so-called liberal professionals - priests, doctors, lawyers, and notaries.  Like Lacombe and Chauveau, but with much more emphasis, Gerin-Lajoie counterpoised the rural and urban milieus, purporting to contrast the decadence of the city, which offered both superficial pleasures and profound misery, with the much simpler and healthier 'natural' environment of the countryside. 

   Gerin-Lajoie had already established a considerable reputation as the author of the song 'Un Canadien errant', about the exiled Patriotes of 1837, and of the historical play Le Jeune Latour, when his treatise-like Jean Rivard appeared in serial form for the first time (with its statistics, quotes from government reports, and copious economic, ethnographic, and linguistic notes).  This, his one and only work of fiction - whose two volumes are subtitled Le Defricheur (The Pioneer), and L'Economiste (The Economist) - would become the most popular novel of the nineteenth century after Les Anciens Canadiens.  Reprinted sixteen times up to 1958, it even ran in serial form in the Paris daily, Le Monde, some fifteen years after its first publication.  The work would be called 'l'evangile rustique de la race' (rustic gospel of the race) because of its preaching of the ideology of agriculturisme, the term coined by historian Michel Brunet for the doctrine of clerical and lay ideologues who mythified and glorified the forced retreat into the countryside of French-Canadian society following the Conquest.  In epic style, using a military vocabulary (victory, conquest, siege, attack), Gerin-Lajoie tells the story of land-clearing in the Eastern Townships and the growth of his hero's 'petite republique', a nearly perfect utopian micro-society. 

   The first volume traces the herculean efforts of Jean Rivard and his loyal disciple, Pierre Gagnon, to clear the land and establish a foothold in the former wilderness.  The second deals with the development of the colony, its growth in population and prosperity and the meteoric rise of the hero from simple pioneer to mayor, justice of the peace, militia major, and a revered member of the legislature.  The colony grows into Rivardville, with its own parish and school board.  The city-country dichotomy is articulated through the correspondence between Rivard and his longtime friend Gustave Charmenil, who is obliged to eke out a living as copyist and translator in Montreal, all the while commenting on the striking contrasts between his dismal life and the heroic feats of Rivard and his followers.  Jean Rivard and the parish priest, Octave Doucet, whose name combines echoes of classical grandeur with gentleness,are the pillars of the civil society in Rivardville.  They are often found past midnight in the presbytery discussing theology and philosophy, or planning the future of their community in the more unlikely location of the Rivards' bedroom where the hero's wife, the perfect Louise, had long been asleep.  Thus Gerin-Lajoie, a founding member and three-times president of the radical-liberal-nationalist Institut canadien de Montreal  - a sort of people's university that was to fight clerical hegemony for several decades - forsakes his earlier forward-looking ideas by conforming to the dominant Church-directed vision of the traditional society and succumbs to the strong ideological pressures of his day.

     Hume's Extreme Skepticism in Treatise I IV 7   1

   Introduction  

   Hume finds himself in an appalling state during Treatise I iv 7 (the conclusion of Book I).  He is almost bereft of beliefs; he believes, for a short time, only that he cannot believe anything else.  But, being an assiduous student of human nature, Hume makes this extreme skeptical crisis into material for naturalistic study.  He carefully reports how extreme skepticism comes about, what it is like, and how it passes. Here I follow Fogelin, who argues that the Treatise supplies a 'natural history of philosophy' - a narrative of the phenomenological and causal sequences of philosophical states of mind.  See Hume's Skepticism in the Treatise of Human Nature (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul 1985), Ch. 7.  See also Fogelin's discussions in 'The Tendency of Hume's Skepticism,' in Burnyeat, ed., The Skeptical Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press 1983); and in 'Hume's Scepticism,' in The Cambridge Companion to Hume, David Fate Norton, ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1993).

   Part of my aim in this paper is to supplement Fogelin by exploring in detail the natural history in I iv 7.  But another part of my aim is to suggest, contra Fogelin, that extreme skepticism is a problem rather than a tool for Hume, and that Hume is better at developing extreme skepticism than he is at domesticating it. 

   An old interpretive tradition ignores or downplays Hume's detached naturalistic reflections in I iv 7, and focuses only on his involved personal experience of skepticism.  Oddly enough, interpretations in this tradition tend to treat Hume's experience dismissively and derisively.  For instance, Thomas Reid notes that Hume philosophizes and is driven to skepticism 'only in solitude and retirement,' while in 'society' he yields 'to the dominion of common sense,' and remarks: 'surely if his friends apprehended this, they would have the charity never to leave him alone.'  But this joke is an unfair response to Hume.  True, only solitude enables Hume to reflect, and so to experience extreme skepticism; but solitude also makes healthy non-skeptical reflection possible, so that the problem Hume presses on us is how to sustain reflection without inviting skepticism.  Moreover, Hume does not present himself as subject to a special malady, as Reid's joke implies; Hume presents himself as a representative philosopher, engaging in full and free reflection and for that reason alone menaced by extreme skepticism.  He then works hard to understand the character of extreme skepticism, and its entanglements with reflection in general.  So Reid's premature ridicule of skepticism only threatens our chance to understand both skepticism and reflection better. 

   It is more common these days to take Hume's naturalism seriously, but ignore or downplay (or treat as a mere mask or stratagem) his personal experience of skepticism.   But this treatment of the text, by focusing only on the fact that Hume the naturalist doesn't consider a permanent state of extreme skepticism to be a live (or livable) option, tends toward a telescoped account of Hume's states of mind in I iv 7.  The generic telescoped account of I iv 7 is: 'Hume draws skeptical conclusions, and can't think of any way to refute them.  Then he immerses himself in everyday life and returns to everyday belief, and that's it.'  But Hume really offers a far richer account of the skeptic's states of mind.  Attending to this rich account of skepticism helps us to appreciate more fully both Hume's naturalism, and his naturalism's problems. 

   So Hume's detailed description of his skeptical experiences deserves close and balanced attention.  As I read the description, it involves seven distinct phases. 

   I Psychological Stage-Setting  

   Hume begins I iv 7 in a doubly reflective mood: he has examined human cognition at length, is about to turn to other matters, and feels inclined to reflect on his results and his prospects.  But from the start his reflections are negative.  He remembers his 'past errors and perplexities,' and that memory convinces him that his faculties are weak, disordered, and altogether in a 'wretched condition' (264).  He sees that he cannot expect any support or comfort from other people; for his philosophy has placed him in a 'forlorn solitude' (264).  He cannot mix with 'the crowd,' for as a philosopher he sees their 'deformity' (264).  But no one will leave the crowd to join him in his unenviable position.  Finally, his solitude does not - as it might  - increase his assurance and determination.  Without the 'approbation of others' (265), he has no confidence in his own reasoning, but instead dreads 'error and absurdity.' All these reflections flow from and reinforce Hume's 'melancholy' and 'despair' (264), and predispose him to skepticism. 

   This epistemological pessimism engulfs Hume suddenly, and fits badly with much of Book I.  Indeed, someone who has read all of Book I except for the Conclusion might reasonably put these words in Hume's mouth: 'having refuted metaphysical conceptions of the understanding and having sketched a proper scientific account of that phenomenon, I am eager to extend the science of human nature by examining the passions and morality.'  How, then, are we to understand Hume's pessimistic turn?  Perhaps in this way: in Book I Part iv, he has seen skeptical arguments (about reason, body, personal identity) triumph again and again.  Each time he has maintained his optimism about cognition by noting that the skeptic's triumph must be ephemeral.  But by I iv 7 Hume's 'sentiments' have been transformed; because of his extended study of skepticism triumphant, despair has displaced hope, and he is ready to think the worst about human cognition, even before reflecting on particular skeptical arguments.  Presently, I will suggest that this sort of pessimistic turn about cognition is not arbitrary; instead, it (or, at least, its possibility) bears an internal relation to investigating cognition naturalistically.  For now, he important point is that Hume's description of extreme skepticism is itself naturalistic - causal - from the ground up: he sets the stage for reviewing extreme skeptical arguments by describing the history and the states of mind that render him receptive to those arguments. 

   II The Triumph of Extreme Skepticism  

   In the second phase of Hume's skeptical progress, he roundly condemns the imagination, the human faculty that is crucial if we are to get and retain many beliefs, and so he plunges into extreme skepticism. 

   Hume reaches extreme skeptical conclusions by citing and reflecting on arguments from Parts iii and iv of Treatise Book I.  But before citing these arguments, he attacks human cognitive faculties in general (not merely, as in the psychological stage-setting I have just discussed, his own cognitive faculties).  The attack is twofold: first, he laments his lack of any 'criterion' of truth (265).  Second, he laments what's left to him (and to the rest of us), namely 'a strong propensity to consider objects strongly in that view, under which they appear to me' (265).  This propensity is the imagination's crucial feature; without the propensity we could have only beliefs about the uninterpreted contents of present consciousness. 

   This attack on the imagination is curious, just as Hume's pessimistic turn at the start of I iv 7 was curious.  In the rest of Book I, Hume has shown that the imagination is a crucial faculty, without which human beings would have few beliefs.  He could now underscore this positive naturalistic result.  Instead, he suggests that the imagination is trivial, before citing any relevant arguments.  Why does Hume attack, rather than extol, the imagination? 

   The simplest answer is that Hume has in mind the arguments that (he believes) force us to think of the imagination as trivial.  Perhaps that is the whole answer.  But I think that there is also at work here an unacknowledged shift of attitude, a sudden move from thinking of the human constitution as epistemically enabling to thinking of it as epistemically disabling.  To elaborate: once we have isolated and described any crucial, causally efficacious feature of human cognition, call it X, X will strike us in two different ways.  Sometimes we will be glad that we have X, because it makes possible so many beliefs (or even so much knowledge).  At other times, though, all our beliefs will seem threatened just because they rest on X, and X seems incapable of bearing so much weight.  When X strikes us as thus insufficient or trivial, arguments against X will come to mind; the shift comes first, the arguments second.  The shift makes entertaining the arguments possible, and makes them seem obviously right.  Naturalistic epistemology will, then, make possible a pessimistic turn, which carries the seeds of extreme skepticism. 10  10 To clarify two important points: (1)  I am not arguing that all naturalists are stuck with pessimism and skepticism, but only that a form of pessimism that makes skepticism psychologically possible, and perhaps also argumentatively plausible, has a non-arbitrary connection to naturalism. (2)  I do not try here to settle the issue how much of Hume's extreme skepticism flows only from his naturalistic commitments as deformed by the 'theory of ideas,' and how much of it flows from other features of his naturalistic commitments.  I assume that something other than the theory of ideas does some work in driving Hume to skepticism - partly because, of the three skeptical arguments Hume cites in I iv 7, only that broached in I iv 4 seems to me to depend irrevocably on the theory of ideas; and partly because Hume seems inclined to think that any 'anatomizing' can 'trivialize.'  On this last matter see (a)  Treatise III iii 6, 620-1; and (b) Hume's letter of 17 September 1739, to Hutcheson, in Grieg, ed., The letters of David Hume (Oxford: Oxford University Press 1932), 32-3. 

   For a forceful statement of the position that Hume's skepticism depends entirely on the thorough deformation of his naturalism by the theory of ideas, see Martin Bell and Marie McGinn, 'Naturalism and Skepticism,' Philosophy 65 (1990) 399-418.  Despite my prima facie disagreement with Bell and McGinn about the role of the theory of ideas, I agree with them that Hume's extreme skepticism is the ruin rather than the helpmate of his naturalism.  I also find valuable their suggestion that the indispensable first step toward skepticism is a certain sort of open-mindedness: namely, the thought that it is after all possible, though unlikely, that fundamental parts of 'our ordinary outlook' are subject to a thoroughly negative theoretical assessment. 

   Mapping this notion of a shift of attitude on to I iv 7 yields the following reading: Hume's pessimistic predisposition to think of the human constitution as an epistemic infirmity creates a tendency to lose all belief; that tendency is expressed and developed in slightly different forms in the different skeptical arguments.  Hume's resistance to these arguments is perfunctory, his progress to skepticism smooth, because he is antecedently inclined to reach skeptical conclusions.  According to this reading, then, Hume takes the crucial step in his skeptical progress at the margins of the text; so that, if we are to understand and criticize skepticism in a way that does justice to Hume, we must ultimately focus not on his detailed skeptical arguments, but on the character (and aptness) of his initial pessimistic shift. 

   However, even if the detailed skeptical arguments Hume cites in I iv 7 play their role only after a pessimistic shift, still their role is essential: they turn epistemic pessimism into skeptical despair, they cause Hume's suspect beliefs to cease to be beliefs.  So, continuing the task of looking closely at Hume's narrative of his states of mind in I iv 7, we need to see what these arguments are and how they do their work. 

   Hume cites three skeptical arguments in I iv 7.  He arranges them so that the second argument removes hopes we are left with after the first, and the third removes hopes we are left with after the second, so that at the end we are deprived of all cognitive hopes. 

   The first argument, from I iv 4, says that the imagination is unreliable because its operation yields a manifest and irremediable contradiction.  The imagination produces causal beliefs, by enlivening certain ideas beyond others when certain impressions are present to the mind.  The imagination also, by following a convoluted and mistake-strewn path, produces the belief that objects continue to exist even when we do not perceive them, and exist distinct from our perception of them.  These two operations of the imagination are, Hume says, 'equally natural and necessary' (266).  And so far, so good, Hume suggests - even though the belief in continued and distinct existence has a dubious heritage, must bear the mark of the bar sinister. 

   But now an inescapably skeptical point emerges: 'in some circumstances' these 'equally natural and necessary' operations 'are directly contrary.'  Why?  Roughly because good causal reasoning tells us not to believe that secondary qualities are anything in the objects themselves, but we cannot conceive of primary qualities being in the objects themselves without conceiving of secondary qualities being in the objects themselves, so that good causal reasoning tells us that we cannot conceive of objects distinct from our perceptions.  That is to say, if we reason causally and carefully, we render the continued and distinct existence of objects inconceivable, and so a fortiori incredible; and if we can conceive of and believe in continued and distinct existence, that can only be because of a failure in causal reasoning.  The details here are obscure, and the argument might well tangle up conception and belief in fatally flawed ways.  But details and flaws aside, the gist of the argument is this: the imagination, by means of two natural and necessary operations, produces two natural and necessary beliefs.  We can have no grounds for preferring one belief to the other.  But the beliefs directly contradict each other.  This problem taints the faculty of the imagination in general, and so taints all its products (our beliefs). 

   With this first argument, if it is sound, Hume has already dealt human cognition a devastating blow; but worse is in store.  For Hume's second argument destroys the fallback position we naturally take up after the first skeptical argument (or at least the fallback position he thinks we naturally take up).  He describes that position in the following passage: 
  This contradiction in our reasoning would be more excusable, were it compensated by any degree of solidity and satisfaction in the other parts of our reasoning ....  Nothing is more curiously esquired after by the mind of man, than the causes of every phenomenon; nor are we content with knowing the immediate causes, but push on our enquiries, till we arrive at the original and ultimate principle.  We would not willingly stop before we are acquainted with that energy in the cause, by which it operates on its effect; that tie, which connects them together; and that efficacious quality, on which the tie depends.  This is our aim in all our studies and reflections .... (266)  

   The suggestion is this: if causal reasoning informs us of necessary connections, that in some measure compensates or consoles us for the skeptical discovery that the imagination produces contradictory beliefs.  That skeptical discovery undercuts the rational status of our causal beliefs; but, if we can discover necessary connections, our causal inquiries still reach deeply satisfying resultes.  

   Unfortunately, Hume notes, there are no necessary connections between events (as he has argued in I iii 14).  There is only a feeling of necessity that we experience when passing from a present impression to the idea of its customary attendant, a feeling that we mistakenly project onto events or 'objects.'

   Reconciliation with Nature: Landscapes by David McMillan and Gary Wilson  
 
 MARTHA HANNA  

   David McMillan and Gary Wilson have rejected unadulterated landscapes in which we can easily indulge our love of nature for views that recognize the realities of the day.  With their recent work, each has realized that what is true encompasses more than visual description.  

   "IT COULD BE CLAIMED that the landscape photograph itself, as a viable and currently-acceptable artistic statement, is vanishing from view with the same rapidity as the natural landscape on the face of the earth.  Perhaps, in the age of TV, no one goes outside anymore" (14).  

   In her article, "The Landscape Photograph in the Postmodern Age," Kathleen Campbell despairs of the value-less philosophy represented by the landscapes that came out of the seventies.  Campbell's attitude reflects a malaise that photographers during the 1980s struggled to overcome.  The photographs of the period seemed detached; photographers searched for a means to reintroduce the personal and emotional, to make visible their engagement with the land. 

   Gary Wilson and David McMillan are two well-known photographers in Canada whose landscapes span the last two decades.  The uncanny similarity of their recent work and the subtle yet remarkable changes that the portfolios exhibit from previous work reflect a desire to openly explore and more critically reveal our relationship with the land. 

   When he began making photographs in the mid-1970s, David McMillan brought to the medium his background in the visual arts.  He had studied painting at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and graduated with a degree in Fine Arts before joining the faculty of the Manitoba School of Art in 1973.  For his first black and white photographs, McMillan created still lifes using objects of different shapes and sizes found around the home and yard.  He was interested in seeing how the composition translated to the two dimensions of the photograph.  He pursued the formal investigation of space further in a later, similarly composed, series of photographs.  To accompany each nine-inch square enlargement, McMillan produced a stereo photograph of the same scene.  The two slightly different perspectives were mounted side by side on a card, sized to fit a stereoscopic viewer.  The audience could examine the print and compare it, using the stereoscope, with the illusory three dimensions of the two photographs combined.  McMillan made evident his conceptual and perceptual investigation by strategically locating the letter D in three places within each still life. 

   This organization of objects and formal arrangement on the picture plane still predominated when he ventured beyond his home and began taking colour photographs of the urban landscape.  The landscape was not new to him: his paintings had included photo-realist outdoor scenes.  During the mid-seventies, colour photography, particularly that of the landscape, was beginning to be recognized as an art form. 1  1 In 1976, American photographer William Eggleston exhibited his colour photographs at the Museum of Modern Art.  Stephen Shore was another influential American photographer who received recognition for his colour photographs in the mid-1970s.  For a discussion of colour landscape photography, see Jussim and Lindquist-Cock 97-102. /  McMillan shifted easily from working with black and white film to colour, making photographs that turned street scenes into compositions of form and colour.  He chose views of street corners, back alleys, parking lots, and gas stations.  In one photograph taken in Banff, Alberta, the perspective is centred on a low peaked-roof building.  Cinder block walls recede from the picture's foreground, converging on either side of the small building and shaping a trapezoidal parking lot.  Two cars, one orange and one blue, are parked on either side of the building's open door.  The elements in the photograph balance the composition.  A white dog by a black dumpster in the left foreground counters the orange car parked on the extreme right.  The undulating edge of a large pool of rainwater marks off an area of dry pavement equivalent to the massive form of a mountaintop that shares the upper third of the photograph with the sky.  The puddle mirrors the central components, losing some clarity in the reflection, but gaining in colour saturation, reinforcing the complementary blue and orange. 

   GARY WILSON'S 1970s landscapes were notable for their regional distinctiveness.  A native of the Maritimes, born in Fredericton in 1951, Wilson began documenting extensively the countryside in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in 1977.  As a historical base for his exploration, he studied the work of nineteenth-century photographers who had been active in the Maritimes.  He concentrated particularly on the photographs of Isaac Erb, a turn of the century commercial photographer from Saint John.  Wilson admired the clarity and consistency of his topographical views (Craig).  In the catalogue introduction to his 1981 exhibition, "Views of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick," Gary Wilson described his photographs as documentary: "This work is an inventory of facts.  Individual photographs contain an accumulation of details which combine to describe a specific landscape.  This exhibition is an accumulation of landscapes which combine to describe a specific region."  Yet the cumulative message of the photographs is their manifestation of the political will of a person concerned about the environment.  Increasingly, Wilson's documentation focused on change in the landscape and places marked by evidence of industrial incursion.  His subjects included gravel quarries, gypsum mines, soil erosion, drainage ditches and a frozen food processing plant.  Typical among them was a photograph of a swath cut through a pine forest as the beginning of a woods road.  The earth was so churned up by heavy machinery that deep furrows and hollows held flood waters.  In another photograph, Wilson depicted the site of a gravel quarry, its scale indicated by the size of an unloading dump truck and the stifling atmosphere by the dust cloud surrounding a crusher.  The detail provided by a camera that produced a six by seven centimetre negative and the even, mid-tone greys of Wilson's print contributed to the image's concreteness and the pallor of the scene.  Elsewhere, changes were less readily apparent, but each landscape was somehow scarred, whether by the channels of erosion from a clearcut, the smoke trail from a grass fire or the tangle of fences and power lines screening the view of a cow pasture. 

   The dry, factual representation of the early work was typical of landscape photographers working during the 1970s and may have been symptomatic of their feelings of alienation.  Photographers suppressed personal expression in favour of a modernist attention to form and factual accounts.  The American photographer Robert Adams was a leader of the 1970s genre of New Topographic Landscapes, giving it both verbal and visual expression in various publications.  The name referred to the similarities with the work of the nineteenth-century geological survey photographers who documented the opening of the American frontier.  Adams's introductory remarks to his book of photographs, Denver: A Photographic Survey of the Metropolitan Area, tell of the attitudes that prevailed at the time: 

   A new city had emerged (though one that looked prematurely worn), a city much like other large urban centres across the Southwest.  To show it accurately required that I stop sorting things out by the degree to which they were picturesque; if beauty were to be discovered in Denver, it had to be on the basis of a radical faith in inclusion.  Shopping centres, junky arroyos, and commercial streets not only had to be more fully acknowledged, but acknowledged amidst the dull, hard grey of pollution. 

   I determined moreover, to stay clear of the mountains.  I distrusted the late Victorians' passion for mountaintop vistas, and decided instead to adopt the perspective of the first settlers, those who saw Colorado from the small rises of the prairie.  

   Usually made with a large-format camera, new topographic photographs were distinctive for their detail, even-toned prints, banal subjects, and concentration on man-made environments. 

   IN MCMILLAN'S PHOTOGRAPHS, cars, signs and fences represented humanity's intervention in the landscape.  Nature was shown in bits and pieces.  The tip of a mountain projected above garage roofs into a space bound by a hydro pole and wires.  Shadows criss-crossed a busy intersection as graphic reminders of the sun.  Clouds or a patch of blue sky gave nature a very small part in the primarily artificial environment.  McMillan's tightly organized and close-cropped images visually exaggerated the urban conditions with cluttered scenes layering objects and colours. 

   Two photographs taken in less built-up environments stand apart both in the depiction of nature and in the more traditional spatial view imposed.  A very old tree dominates one.  It has aggregated a variety of plant life, but is itself leafless and possibly at the end of its years.  McMillan took the other photograph at the forested edge of a construction site.  The pile of earth heaped up beside a hole creates the impression of a gravesite, suggesting the impending death of nature. 

   In retrospect, these photographs, taken in 1981, anticipate the shift in McMillan's recent work.  He has moved away from contemporary suburbia, literally stepping back from his subject to provide a fuller view.  Civilization's impact on nature is lessened, giving nature a more prominent role, whether in fact or by implication.  Even in photographs of towns or industrial locations, nature's form, colour, and atmosphere set the tone.  The rolling landscape of West Virginia offers pleasant memories to a tourist, despite the ugliness and environmental threat of the garbage dump with which it shares the frame.  In Chester, West Virginia, mist rising from the river mitigates what would otherwise be an industrial scene. 

   SIMILARLY, IN HIS NEW SERIES, Gary Wilson neutralizes the impact of industrialization on the land.  The overall impression has changed.  His outlook is broader, his subject less specific.  Addressing the ambivalence of his documentation, Wilson began to put his photographs in context.  "Rather than a journalistic approach to subject matter, requiring an extensive literary form and 'reductionist' conclusion, the symbolic possibilities of certain photographs could be effectively 'placed' within a body of work to help in its reading.  In this way my concern over abusive land-use, and the fear of quick sentimental and ahistorical interpretations of man / nature interaction might be included with the general optimism of the project" (Wilson, Letter, November 1985).  Signs of economic growth still appear in the photograph of a clearcut but the enduring strength of the land, symbolized by a lone tree that survives the devastation of the hillside, offers hope and represents the power of nature hidden in the previous work. 

   Along with environmental concerns, nature itself appeared to activate the photographers's response during the 1980s.  In the US, the catastrophic affect of natural disasters, particularly the eruption of Mount St Helens, served to awaken photographers to nature's explosive power.  Photographs taken by Frank Gohlke and others emerged as a strong counterpoint to the overwhelming culture of the new topographic landscapes. 

   BOTH DAVID MCMILLAN AND GARY WILSON clearly demonstrate their great love of nature.  In these photographs, nature is not simply acted upon but presents itself in dramatic ways: in a rainbow, in the dark cloud of an impending storm, and in the flood waters caused by an ice jam in the St John River. 

   With nature's strength comes evidence of our own vulnerability.  Ultimately we are surrendered to the land, as both photographers remind us, one with a view of a pioneer cemetery in Coldstream, New Brunswick, the other of a historic burial plot in northwestern Mississippi.  Their recent photographs convey our physically and spiritually complex relationship with the land, and how the symbiosis is embedded in our psyche.  Spiritual overtones live in the clarity of light reminiscent of luminist paintings.  Wilson's photograph, Meduxnekeag River at Jackson Falls is an all-encompassing view, taken from a point above the falls.  The people fishing at the edge of the river are so small in relation to the landscape that they become simply details in the scene. 

   The depth of attention McMillan gives to certain objects, places or moments imbues his photographs with metaphysical meaning.  The elements of a fence post shown from a distorted angle, graffiti, a view veiled by a grove of trees all combine with the transient moment of a ship's passing to imply a sense of otherness.  McMillan releases the photographs from a mainly informative function and leaves them open to poetic interpretation.  These photographs are not symbolic in a way that metaphorically equates human and natural forms or qualities.  Nor are they analogies for the fundamental structures that govern all life.  Instead of having such timeless qualities, the sensitivity of Wilson and McMillan's photographs stems more from references specifically linked to time and experience. 
 
   Wilson alludes to time through change, by focusing on elements old and new.  Man-made structures come and go in relatively rapid succession.  A Halifax city block is slated for re-development, a heritage home is ravaged by fire.  The oil rig in Halifax harbour is already a historic monument.  A giant tree in the centre on one photograph marks time as a constant in the changing facade of successive historic views of the street. 
 
   The photograph, Elm (Chapel Street) Woodstock, Carleton Co, New Brunswick, could depict a street in any number of towns in North America.  For Wilson, who grew up in Woodstock, it may have personal relevance but it stikes a chord in most viewer.  Signs relate to the past: the architecture, the ample spacing of the houses, the perennity of the elm.  Given its size, the tree must have been significant in the profile of the street and possibly of the town, serving as a point of reference in the history and geography.  Its importance is emphasized in the photograph by its centrality, by its grandeur in relation to the other objects and vegetation, and by its near perfect form silhouetted against the sky.  As the main element in the photograph, the tree influences the nostalgic character and is chiefly responsible for the warm feelings aroused by the picture.  Closer inspection brings the realization that the tree is dead.  Ironically, the photograph also contrasts the denuded elm with the smaller trees in full leaf.  The photograph's negative aspect, that the tree we are looking at is probably a victim of Dutch Elm disease, is more difficult for us to contemplate. 
 


     Enlightenment and Academe: 
   The University in the Eighteenth Century  
  P.B. WOOD

   Given the special relationship assiduously cultivated in recent years by Britain and the United States, it is hardly surprising that during the last decade Margaret Thatcher has done more for American universities than anyone since Hitler.  Having created a thoroughly unhealthy climate within the British university system and driven many talented academics into lucrative exile in the us, Mrs Thatcher can at least now rest content with the thought that the successful export of scholarly expertise helps to silence potential critics of her brave new world, to improve Britain's ailing balance of trade, and to trim public expenditure.  It is therefore highly ironic that amid the tribal chants of "Market Forces Rule OK" and the educational hooliganism of Thatcher's Tory supporters, there has been a veritable renaissance in Britain of the study of the history of universities, which has enriched and sometimes transformed our knowledge of European academic life since the foundation of the first universities in Salerno, Paris, Montpellier, and Bologna in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.  

   Prior to the late 1970s, the golden age of university history in Britain was unquestionably the nineteenth century.  One needs only point to the volumes penned by Hastings Rashdall on the medieval European universities, those by J.B. Mulinger on Cambridge, those by Alexander Bower and Sir Alexander Grant on Edinburgh, or the series of Oxford college histories published between 1898 and 1903 to see that the Victorian era witnessed a remarkable flowering of British scholarship dedicated to the development of institutions of higher learning throughout western Europe.  But since then, the field has had a more chequered career.  For much of this century, a large proportion of the literature produced has been either anecdotal or antiquarian in character, and often published to celebrate institutional milestones.  While it would be churlish to deny that at least some of this commemorative work has been highly valuable, it would also be true to say that until recently comparatively little historical attention was paid to such topics as the prosopography of student bodies and of the professoriate, the changes in university curricula, or the frequently unedifying realm of academic politics; and it was only in the 1960s that the study of university history took on a more analytical edge.  Books edited or written by George Davie, Hugh Kearney, Sheldon Rothblatt, Lawrence Stone, and E.G.W. Bill signalled renewed vigour, and the subsequent appearance of important studies by Robert Anderson, Davie, and John Gascoigne among others has confirmed the scholarly health of the field.  As if to consolidate this revival, and mark the emergence of yet another academic sub-discipline, the annual History of Universities was launched in 1981 by the late Charles Schmitt, following a highly successful conference on the theme held at the Warburg Institute in London in 1978, and the continued vitality of this journal attests to the flourishing state of university history (as opposed to the universities themselves) in Britain. 

   So too in their different ways do the fifth volume of The History of the University of Oxford, which covers the period c. 1688-1800, and Laurence Brockliss's meticulously crafted French Higher Education in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries.  The Oxford History is something of a curate's egg, for it is made up of 32 essays of variable quality covering a wide variety of topics.  Historiographically, the volume is highly traditional in its focus, since the bulk of the contributions deal with such themes as religion and politics in the university, while the study of student life, for example, is conspicuous by its absence.  Nonetheless, a number of the chapters, like those by the late G.V. Bennett on the "rage of party" in Oxford in the period 1688-1714, are of a high standard, and it must be said that the University - supported project from which the History derives reflects a refreshing and perhaps even enlightened institutional sense of the value of university history.  Brockliss's monograph, on the other hand, is more in tune with recent historiographical trends, and hence deals with topics like student life and the wider cultural significance of the university curriculum in the ancien regime.  As befits a work dealing with France, there are even a number of maps illustrating the geographical distribution of universities and colleges drawn in typical Annales fashion.  While the Oxford volume is sometimes impressionistic and occasionally lacking in analytical rigour, Brockliss combines close archival research with a broad historical vision, and his book exemplifies the considerable virtues of the research on the development of European universities currently being produced by British scholars.

   Thanks in part to the memoirs of Edward Gibbon, the dominant image of eighteenth-century Oxford is one of professorial negligence and intellectual torpor.  Looking back on his brief sojourn at Magdalen College in 1752-53 Gibbon condemned the "narrow, lazy, and oppressive" spirit prevalent in the two English universities, and affirmed in a memorable passage that "[t]o the University of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation; and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother.  I spent fourteen months at Magdalen College; they proved ... the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life" (29-30).  Adam Smith, who was a Snell Exhibitioner at Balliol from 1740 until 1746, echoed Gibbon's harsh judgment.  In The Wealth of Nations, Smith contended that the system of class fees common in the Scottish universities encouraged professors to exert themselves in their teaching, and he contrasted the happy effects of competition in the academic market place with the dismal state of universities in which the professoriate was supported primarily by fixed salaries.  Such a method of payment, Smith argued, promoted idleness, and he observed that "[i]n the university of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching" (I: 247; compare Reid, "Statistical Account" 1: 229-31).  Oxford also came in for some sharp criticism from another Glasgow academic, George Jardine, who lectured on logic at the University from 1774 until his death in 1827.  In his Outlines of Philosophical Education, Jardine challenged the smug self-satisfaction of the apologists for the ancient seats of learning south of the Tweed, and argued that the tutorial system employed by the English and Irish universities stifled the intellectual development of the young.  Like Smith, Jardine underlined the beneficial effects of competition or "emulation," and insisted that "all the faculties of the mind are exerted, and powers unused before, are awakened into life and activity" in the atmosphere of the (Scottish) lecture hall (464).  

   The French universities did not fare much better in the eyes of the enlightened.  While residing at La Fleche in 1735, David Hume remarked to an English correspondent: "As to a celebrated Professor, I do not know, if there is such to be met with at present in any part of France, especially for the Sciences, in which generally the French are much inferior to our own Countrymen" (Mossner 32).  Smith too was critical, claiming in The Wealth of Nations that the French universities illustrated the pernicious effects of ecclesiastical and political control over academic appointments (2: 247-48).  Predictably, Voltaire sniped at the universities as well.  Like Gibbon, he associated them with monkishness and barbarism, and Voltaire contrasted the professoriate (as well as the Academicians of his time) with "the true scholars shut up in their studies ... [who] have nearly all been persecuted" (274).  But perhaps the most damning attack on French higher education came in Jean D'Alembert's article "College," in the third volume of the Encyclopedie.  For D'Alembert there took a very dim view of the benefits of a college education: 

   [U]n jeune homme apres avoir passe dans un college dix annees, qu'on doit mettre au nombre de plus precieuses de sa vie, en sort, lorsqu'il a le mieux employe son tems, avec la connoissance tres-imparfaite d'une langue morte, avec des preceptes de Rhetorique & des principes de Philosophie qu'il doit ta; cher d'oublier; souvent avec une corruption de moeurs dont l'alteration de la sante est la moindre suite; quelquefois avec des principes d'une devotion mal-entendue; mais plus ordinairement avec une connoissance de la Religion si superficielle, qu'elle succombe a la premiere conversation impie, ou a la premiere lecture dangereuse. (635)  

   The philosophes on both sides of the Channel were, therefore, largely hostile to traditional educational institutions like Oxford or the various French universities, but were their criticisms entirely just? 

  II 

   In order to answer this question, I want to juxtapose the intellectual record of Oxford and the French universities in the eighteenth century as presented in the volumes under review, with that of their counterparts in Scotland.  For the assessments of Oxford and the French schools quoted above contrast markedly with contemporary perceptions of the Scottish colleges (and not just those of the Scots themselves).  Recent work on the cultural milieu of eighteenth-century Scotland has shown that the universities of North Britain helped nurture the Scottish Enlightenment, which is hardly surprising in view of the fact that such leading lights as Joseph Black, William Cullen, Adam Ferguson, John Millar, Thomas Reid, and Adam Smith were all members of the professoriate.  Brockliss himself draws attention to the need for such a comparative dimension when discussing the history of the curriculum, and in what follows I shall engage in mapping the kind of "curricular topography of the early-modern university" which he calls for (Brockliss 448). 

   Let us consider first the cultivation of classical learning.  Although the philosophes are sometimes seen as championing the cause of the moderns rather than that of the ancients, they in fact generally subscribed to the common view that a knowledge of the classics was necessary in the republic of letters.  Gibbon, for example, went up to Oxford hoping to master Greek and Latin, only to have his hopes shattered by the indifference of his tutors, while D'Alembert claimed that Latin should be the language of philosophy (Gibbon 30, 34-37; D'Alembert, Preliminary Discourse 93).  Indeed, Peter Gay has argued that during the Enlightenment the philosophes drew a good deal of inspiration from the authors of pagan antiquity (2: 31-203).  Some of Gay's claims may be difficult to document, but Brockliss's findings at least corroborate Gay's insistence on the centrality of the classics in the Weltanschauung of the age, for even though the teaching of Greek seems to have declined in France during the second half of the eighteenth century, in the ancien regime students spent a good deal of their six years at university studying Latin.  Furthermore, they were expected to become fluent speakers as well as stylish writers, because Latin continued to be used as the language of classroom instruction in virtually all of their courses.  Similarly, at Oxford the classics formed the core of the formal curriculum, though here too Greek became an increasingly marginal subject as the century wore on, and the extent to which English displaced Latin in lectures and tutorials is unclear (Sutherland and Mitchell 513-33).  

   The classics fared somewhat differently in Scotland, in so far as there was a revival of Greek scholarship in the early eighteenth century which was linked to the philosophical and mathematical interests of men such as Francis Hutcheson and his Glasgow colleague Robert Simson, and the study of Latin occupied a subsidiary, though nonetheless important, place in the curriculum of the Scottish universities.  Thus students usually studied Latin and Greek most intensively at the beginning of their course, and after their second year they switched their attention primarily to mathematics, and to natural and moral philosophy.  Moreover, from roughly the 1740s onwards their lectures were largely in English, though Latin was often used on public occasions (Reid, Philosophical Orations).  Of greater significance is the fact that the professors responsible for instruction in Greek and Latin indulged in philosophical or historical reflections on the materials they dealt with in their advanced classes, so that their students were introduced to topics in political theory or to conjectural history in the context of their classical studies (Emerson 69-70).  Consequently, the classical education received by students at the Scottish universities was closer in character to that given in France, and was probably more closely linked to the other branches of learning covered in the curriculum than was the case at Oxford.  Having completed their courses on the languages, literature, and culture of the ancient world, students in eighteenth-century Scotland normally proceeded to the heart of the curriculum, namely the study of moral and natural philosophy.  In The Democratic Intellect, George Davie contended that the distinctive feature of the Scottish university system prior to the Anglicising reforms of the nineteenth century was the philosophical focus of undergraduate education.  Subsequent research has largely confirmed Davie's intuitions, and Brockliss's work, along with the relevant essays in the Oxford History, serves to underline the contrast between the Scottish experience and the patterns of instruction in France and at Oxford.  In Scotland, the philosophy course typically encompassed what we would now call the natural sciences and the sciences of man and society, so that the arts student would commonly attend (with minor variations) lectures on mechanics, pneumatics, electricity and magnetism, optics, astronomy, the philosophy of mind, logic, rhetoric, ethics, jurisprudence, and politics, which would be supplemented by prelections on mathematics, and in some cases on natural and civil history.

     Past Pleasures: New Film Histories  
   CATHERINE RUSSELL  

   Louis Lumiere, one of the inventors of the cinematographe, described the device that projected moving pictures as "an invention without a future."  Anticipating the debates that would plague this curious phenomenon throughout its existence, Lumiere saw the historical limits and conditions that would define his invention.  What is it for?  What should it be for?  Who uses it and why?  While the numerous histories of the cinema that have been produced since 1914 (only 19 years after the Lumieres' and Thomas Edison's first demonstrations) have supplied ample lists of titles, names, and dates, these kind of questions are often quelled by the spurious epithet: entertainment. 

   In the last 10 years, increased interest in film history has been only partly due to the recognition of the poverty of existing film histories.  It is also a response to the ahistoricism of the poststructuralist critical theory that dominated cinema studies in the I970s.  The turn to history on the part of many film scholars is in many cases an attempt to integrate some of the insights provided by textual theory into the lived history of film texts.  History in this sense refers to the constitution of audiences in terms of class, gender, and race, conditions of reception and funding, and extracinematic culture.  Only through consideration of the consumption of film texts can "the cinema" as a social phenomenon be adequately addressed.  And yet historians with these ambitions do not carry out statistical analyses of box office receipts and attendance figures (although interesting work has been done on the urban geography of nickelodeons).  For the most part, the practice of such historians remains narrative analysis, but rather than identifying the redeeming features of a given work, their aim is to identify the spectator addressed by the texts of a given period and the institutionalization of that address in film genres. 

   Two histories of German cinema, corresponding to the two "high points" of that national cinema - the films of the Weimar Republic (1920s) and those of the 1970s - are especially acute studies of the engagement of contemporary audiences with the films.  Patrice Petro's Joyless Streets: Women and Melodramatic Representation in Weimar Germany is a much needed antidote to the prevailing historicization of German Expressionism as a prophecy of the Third Reich and to histories that canonized great-but-anxious artist-heroes eventually exiled to Hollywood.  Thomas Elsaesser's lengthy study of an equally brief moment in German history fills in the background and the spaces among the three directors, Werner Herzog, R.W. Fassbinder, and Wim Wenders, who made "New German Cinema" an international phenomenon.  In both books, the abyss of the Nazi period and its difficult aftermath, in which film production was little more than propaganda (during) and American colonization (after), underlines the urgency of defining the German spectator outside the overwhelming mystifications of fascism. 

   Two books on American cinema, although perhaps not "histories" in a conventional sense, isolate groups of Hollywood films that delineate histories within the larger history of American studio production.  Rick Altman and Robert Lang manage, with different degrees of success, to trace out histories of American desires in the contexts of the Hollywood musical and melodrama respectively.  If film in the US can be handily dismissed as "entertainment," it is the responsibility of the historian to find out what entertainment has meant at different times.  For what desires does it portend to offer satisfaction? And whose desires are they? The two studies in question take very different approaches to genre, but in both cases the differences within genre films and the subtle variations on a narrative formula demonstrate shifts in modes of address that correspond to different historical spectators. 

   While all four of these histories embrace feminist cultural analysis, Petro's study of Weimar cinema, as its title suggests, takes the most systematically feminist approach.  Her project is to recover an inscription of female spectatorship from a body of films that has been until now discussed as a cinema produced by men for men.  No one, not even Petro, would argue with Siegfried Kracauer's observation that the male Weimar protagonists tended to be weak, passive, and anxiety-ridden.  Indeed Petro expands on the androgyny and homoeroticism of many of these films, but rather than situating the representational and narrative instability within the context of modernism, as critics since Kracauer have done, she suggests that these films might have provided an inscription of "emancipation" for female viewers.  This is not to argue for any actual relief from patriarchal oppression for the women of Germany in the 1920s, but to point to a place where their desires might have found representation. 

   Although the trajectory of Joyless Streets is towards the analysis of four key films of the 1920s (one of them titled Joyless Street), Petro sets up these analyses with an examination of the gender politics of the period, which of course informed other discourses besides the cinema.  In the cultural theories of Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, and Martin Heidegger (three important predecessors of the postwar Frankfurt School), German cities, especially Berlin, were consistently described as female.  Moreover, as these theorists tackled the transformation of vision and the gaze that the industrial metropolis was affecting, the female viewer came to symbolize a distracted and fragmented mode of perception.  Women were becoming a highly visible presence in Weimar Germany, not only at the movies, but in the workplace and on the street.  But they also remained at home, fulfilling more traditional roles.  Petro argues against the prevailing conception of "mass culture" - a term that acquired currency precisely in the Weimar context - and for a culture that included not only women, but many different kinds of women, whose place within a rapidly changing environment was negotiated within a politics of spectatorship. 

   In the illustrated press, a genre that boomed between the wars, images of women tended to fall into two categories that appeared in both left- and right-wing publications.  The first and perhaps the most familiar icon is that of the New Woman, the female consumer in highly masculinized attire.  In magazines such as Die Dame, these fashion layouts would have been addressed to a female reader, matching her new buying power with a loss of sexuality.  The second representation was that of the proletarian mother, typically pregnant and drawn or lithographed in round, dark lines.  Adhering to melodramatic conventions, these images participated in a discourse of pathos, which in the leftist press (Internationale Arbeiterhilfe and Arbetier Illustrierte Zeitung) was rhetorically opposed to the bourgeois New Woman, situating anti-capitalist and reproductive values on the site of the female body.  "The address to female voters emphasizes class contradiction, whereas the address to male voters calls for class reconciliation" (139), suggesting that, when addressed to female readers, the iconography of gender takes on meanings other than "male anxiety and fear" (110). 

   The address to women was therefore paradoxical; on one hand women were the symbols of political and economic "liberation," and on the other they represented the suffering of the underclasses.  In the gothic fantasy films of the early 1920s, such as Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, feminine sexuality lurks behind the hysteria of mise en scene and violence; the deep anxiety of the male characters is almost always released on the terror of virginal brides.  Not surprisingly, it is in the figure of the prostitute that these two discourses of modernity and pathos come together, and such figures abound in the Weimar cinema.  The main actresses of the period - Marlene Dietrich, Louise Brooks, Asta Nielson, and Henny Porten - frequently played women who, in the latest fashions (often tending toward androgyny), used their bodies in desperate, and almost always failed, attempts to survive in a cruel, cruel world.  Petro argues that the visual excess of these silent films (lighting, staging, pacing, and violence that strain the bounds of realism)is born of the impossible contradiction between the iconic New Woman and the poor chances of her social mobility.  In melodrama, the pathos of women's contradictory situation is realized in concrete situations. 

   If mass culture was characterized as female and if modernism was the province of male anxiety, then the politics of representation were indeed the politics of gender in Weimar Germany.  The presence of women at the movies in Weimar and elsewhere in the 1920s was in many respects their entry into official culture.  The production of "women's films," films with female protagonists who suffer and usually die, and their public exhibition provided the "conditions of visibility" for women: they were addressed as spectators and desiring subjects.  Petro might be accused of excluding class and sex-bound male spectators from the pleasures that she identifies in Weimar cinema, and yet the work stands as an exemplary model of historiography.  She manages to acquire some distance from the evaluative discourses of modernism and mass culture, but not by moving away from the canons of German Expressionism and Kammerspiel street realism).  In order to point to textual expressions of frustrated desires for social and sexual emancipation, she attends to the social representations that underscore the formal innovations of some very well-known films. 

   However much one might admire Petro's project in Joyless Streets, it is hard not to have lingering doubts about the audiences that she assumes for the films.  Elsaesser's New German Cinema also has this problem.  Where Petro cites a 1914 dissertation to support her claim that "a vast number of filmgoers in Germany were women" in the 1920s (xx), Elsaesser relies rather heavily on the writing of Michael Rutschky (particularly an essay called "Dreaming the Real" ) for his characterization of the Bohemian politicos who supposedly frequented German cinemas in the 1970s.  Neither source is either authoritative or terribly convincing, and yet it seems to be necessary for both historians that they demonstrate the empirical existence of those spectators who, they claim, are addressed by the texts in question.  One would almost prefer that they stuck to the textual evidence alone if they were not prepared to offer empirical confirmation of their findings.  It may not be possible to know with any certainty the make-up of historical audiences in terms of gender, class, or political orientation, but if film history is going to move away from narratives of great works and to be able to account for the cinema in its larger sense, it is essential that audiences be accounted for by some means. 

   The New German Cinema, Elsaesser argues, can only be described as a coherent entity in terms of its address to an historically specific audience.  In North America, postwar German film has been represented by only a handful of directors and very few films made before 1975.  And yet it was in 1962 that a group of German filmmakers signed the Oberhausen Manifesto, simultaneously tolling the death of the "old cinema" and instituting a system of federal subsidies for German film that continues to the present day.  The Young German Film, as Elsaesser calls the work that immediately followed Oberhausen, had a "false start," though.  Its proponents fell into two distinct sets: those (e.g., Kluge, Straub) who challenged the Hollywood norm so radically that they antagonized their potential audience, and those who fell too easily into the Hollywood pattern and used the generous subsidies for poor imitations of the American competition.  The New German cinema did not come into its own until filmmakers were able to find a middle ground between the avant-garde and the commercial cinema and were able to address an emergent group of spectators in the wake of the late 1960s student movements. 

   If Weimar cinema was torn between mass culture and modernism, the New German Cinema was characterized by a similar split.  As a subsidized industry, film was (officially) designated a cultural product that might revamp a debilitated national cinema, but from the outset this cinema was an "author's cinema" (Autoren), built around the efforts of individual directors.  The duality of art and popular culture, further institutionalized in the crucial role of television in this revamped industry, hinged on the figure of the "visionary" artist hero who became him or herself a commodity in the culture industry.

     The 1989-90 Toronto Theatre Season  
  RONALD BRYDEN 

   "Toronto could be a very good theatre town," a new resident said to me last winter, "if only it would stop worrying whether it's a world-class one." I could see what she meant.  For several seasons now the dominant note of the city's theatrical culture has been anxiety, which notoriously impairs most kinds of performance.  First there was the anxiety whether home-made Canadian produce could stand up to such spectacular invading juggernauts as Les Miserables and The Phantom of the Opera.  That led to some unfriendly notices of the musicals when they arrived, which in turn uncovered odd, congested knots of paranoia among the builders and boosters who rattled gold chains at each other at The Phantom's opening galas.  To knock the glitziest theatrical offering in the city's history, they complained to the editor of The Globe and Mail, was treason to the city itself, its manifest destiny to become the Dallas of the North.  Any nay-sayer questioning Toronto's right to share long-running Lloyd Webber musicals with London, New York, and Tokyo should be ridden out of town on a rail, while we still have rails. 

   Both concerns were answered, in different ways, by the startling success of George Walker's local comedy Love and Anger, a glitzless lampoon of those movers and shakers who would make Toronto, as someone in the play put it, a place satisfying only to baseball fans and real estate dealers.  Under the probosces of the singing mastodons, this racked up the longest run so far recorded by a straight Canadian play (its nearest rival, John Krizanc's Tamara, presumably may be classed as bent) in the city's annals.  Its apotheosis was its transfer by Garth Drabinsky, The Phantom's local franchisee, to the large auditorium of the St Lawrence Centre for a commercial run.  But this success, as success does, opened new vistas of anxiety.  Could Walker's modest six-character effort live up to its publicity, or even cover the cost of the campaign that blazoned it on half the bus shelters in town?  It is one thing to sell 300 seats for 30 weeks in the unthreateningly tacky Factory Theatre, out among the warehouses of the garment district; another to sell 900 for 10 weeks in a spiffy, plum-carpeted civic showcase.  And suppose it did succeed there?  Might that not be more ominous still?  Might it not signify the fulfilment of every anti-Free Trade patriot's nightmare: that to meet the challenge of American mass culture, our Canadian arts might shed their shy, specific charm and learn the blatant trick of vulgar popularity? 

   It might have eased the Toronto theatre's anxieties had it paused to consider that it was already world class in its worries.  Like London, Paris, and most western capitals, it has suffered the pains of subsidy withdrawal during a decade of Thatcherite retrenchment in public expenditure.  The thriving theatrical culture spread across the country by the Canada Council's first 20 years of nurturing has had its milk ration cut, as Mrs Thatcher cut that of Britain's schoolchildren, and been told to get out and hustle the private sector for sponsorships, the arts bureaucrat's euphemism for advertising.  Dismay and confusion were inevitable, as a theatre bred up to pursue art for the sake of art and national expression tried to learn how to blend those aims with the wiles of showbiz and the notions of good taste that obtain in corporate PR departments.  No wonder the face of Toronto's theatre of late has sometimes recalled that of the wife in Thurber's cartoon, a distressed matron near the end of her tether, at whom her husband has thrown the sardonic question: "And how do you propose to live?  By your wits?" 

   Fortunately the Toronto stage has at least one wit to live by.  George Walker's remarkable success holds useful lessons for his co-workers, both in how to do things right in a mixed theatrical economy and in how to look out for what may go wrong.  A lot went right for Love and Anger as popular entertainment, but a few things may have gone wrong for it as a political statement.  As a play, it is an organic growth of subsidized theatre, its form and language rooted in the complex of attitudes that make for public support to the arts.  Yet somehow a larger commercial audience that rejects most of those attitudes took the play to its bosom.  Did it convert them?  Did they not believe it meant it?  Or did they just hear it wrong?  Did it not say what it meant loudly and clearly enough? 

   On the face of it, the last question should be absurd.  Walker, who has taken to directing his plays himself, does so on the apparent first principle that everyone should shout as loudly as possible, as actors used to on old radio comedy shows.  It would be nice to think that he does this from modesty about his skills as a comic writer, a fear that his wit would fall dead unless packaged in a generalized roar of raucous good humour.  But the evidence suggests rather that it is part of a systematic commitment to populism: a belief that to expect audiences to appreciate the acting skill that points a deftly turned witticism, or the skill of the writing itself, is to trade in elitism, excluding the audience that enjoys the Canadian Air Farce.  As a result, he writes scripts whose affinities are with Wilde, Orton, and Ronald Firbank and entrusts them to casts whose models are Wayne, Schuster, Fibber McGee and Molly. 

   This systematic populism runs deep into the texture of his writing.  In the first full-length academic study of Walker's work, Dr Catherine Smith demonstrates the parodic use his plays make, apart and together, of two of the most popular genres of the old Hollywood: the film noir thriller that walked the mean streets of America and the crazy family comedies of Frank Capra.  Love and Anger, like his previous Toronto comedies Better Living, Beautiful City, and Criminals in Love, draws on both of them.  The Toronto that lies beyond Petie Maxwell's basement law office is clearly as violent and corrupt as the Los Angeles of The Blue Dahlia or The Big Sleep, but the tiny ad hoc family he gathers around him to fight it is as amiably demented as the Sycamores of Capra's You Can't Take It With You.  

   The problem with this is that the two genres build from incompatible premises.  In Capra's comic world there can be no real villains.  The benign madness of his crazy families is to believe everyone basically good, deep down, when liberated from the rat-race of capitalist competition.  The happy endings that prove them saner than the societies around them win the villains over to love, leisure, and apple pie.  The premise of the film noir is the antithesis of this.  The secret chivalry of its soiled, disillusioned heroes is to go on pitting themselves, hopelessly and romantically as Don Quixote, against a world that every morning brings forth a new crop of evil, endemic and ineradicable, for them to challenge again.  If there were any real chance of their winning more than compromised local victories that turn sour in the mouth, they wouldn't be heroes and the young wouldn't collect Humphrey Bogart posters. 

   This contradiction works against what I think Walker wants Love and Anger to say.  Its goodies are Petie Maxwell, a former Bay Street shark born again to champion life's minnows - a poor man's Clayton Ruby, so to speak - and the cellarful of eccentric waifs and strays he has conscripted as disciples.  The baddies are John "Babe" Connor, proprietor of "a fascist rag that panders to everything weak and uncertain and uninformed in the human race" with bimbos on page three and sports everywhere else, and his lawyer, a boyish charmer from Rosedale and Upper Canada College who will do anything for a developer's fee and lunch at the Granite Club.  They're monsters, but on the same stage as Maxwell and his "little people" they become fun monsters, impossible to take seriously: so outrageously villainous that, in broad, funny performances by Benedict Campbell and Hardee T. Lineham, they seem almost cute.  It's as if Walker's love for his city compelled him to make even its bad guys endearing.  To be sure, his ending says "But seriously, folks ...." The little people win a local victory, Maxwell dies promising to start younger next time, and the monsters escape to continue towering over the skyline like King Kong, the Sky-dome their jacuzzi.  But as we all know, in the popular imagination the old Hollywood understood so well, it's the giant ape that commands the audience's sneaking admiration.  So too here. 

   It's hard to resist the suspicion that Love and Anger's success (it's said that lawyers packed the Factory Theatre nightly, in their suits) may have been due to a misapprehension.  Given its noisy, driving production, and some spirited comic acting not only by the villains but by Claire Coulter as Maxwell's reluctant secretary, a granite Torontonian handmaid of the goddess Decorum, and Nancy Beatty as her loosely hinged sister, it may have been all too easy to mistake the play for a "roast" - that peculiar North American bonding ritual in which a banquet hall of middle-aged males in dinner jackets proclaim their love for one of their number by alternately embracing and insulting him.  It was interesting to observe at the St Lawrence Centre, where the production's boisterousness was diluted by the larger space it had to fill, that the play became less funny and more witty.  The harsh edge of Walker's writing cut through the muffling geniality of his staging.  But that may have been why, even after that deluge of publicity, the performance I saw was only two-thirds full, as compared with the sell-out house into whose back row I squeezed at the Factory Theatre. 

   The anxieties of operating in a mixed theatrical economy, trying to reconcile the aesthetic of subsidized theatre with the taste of mainstream commercial audiences, almost sank that brave experiment, the Canadian Stage Company.  Carrying forward a heavy deficit from its previous seasons, it needed to play safe, which in the theatre means offering known quantities.  But its artistic director, Guy Sprung, preferred the risk and excitement of staging new work, hoping to astound the city by discovering unknown Canadian genius.  The result was that it wobbled uneasily, and for the most part unsuccessfully, between the subsidized theatre's traditional appeal to patriotism - don't just look for entertainment, buy Canadian and take life seriously - and attempts to compete with the waltzing scenery and falling chandeliers of the multi-national spectaculars, bred by Cats out of Nicholas Nickleby and Trevor Nunn's resolve to woo into theatres the audiences for rock concerts and TV costume serials. 

   Thus a mainstage revival of Fire, the rock-and-gospel musical that had made its way from Thunder Bay, Vancouver, and Edmonton to a sell-out run at Theatre Passe-Muraille in 1988, fell between the two stools of selling a noisy, mindless good time and maintaining a thoughtful Canadian distance from the Bible Belt's favourite forms of pious and profane ecstasy.  For most of the evening, we viewed dispassionately the accumulating resemblances between the white-shoed fervour of a TV evangelist much like Jimmy Swaggart and the down-and-dirty abandon of a piano-wrecker even more like Swaggart's cousin Jerry Lee Lewis.  Then with a blaze of amplifiers the show would lose its anthropological cool and invite us to surrender to the physical excitement that is the goal of a rock concert, gospel tent, or Broadway musical. 

   It might have had a better chance had it been able to muster more than 10 bodies on stage to match the sense of occasion whomped up electronically by "Good Golly, Miss Molly" and "Great Balls of Fire." Ted Dykstra, in the Jerry Lee Lewis role, almost seemed to double their number when he was in evidence, leaping and somersaulting about the set like a handful of firecrackers.  But when he left the scene, we were back with a decent, serious, low-powered Canadian comment on the incestuous links between evangelical religion in the southern US and the unholy joys of rock-and-roll.  For the show to succeed, it needed to be American and not a comment: telling its American story with whole-hearted complicity and breast-beating guilt, not flattering its audience with a sense of how exotic and alien these passions were.
