  PART 1: A LITTLE HISTORY 

   We humans are profoundly social animals.  The biological success of our species - our numbers, our worldwide distribution - depends in no small measure on our ability to acquire behaviour socially: to use and, over generations, to improve upon one another's responses to environmental challenge.  Members of our species, however, are not unique in using the behaviour of others to guide their own responses to life's demands.  Like us, various insects, fishes, birds, and mammals can exploit the behaviour of conspecifics to bias their own behavioural development in adaptive directions. 

   We humans are, apparently, exceptional in our spontaneous use of arbitrary signs and symbols to communicate with our fellows.  We may well be unusual both in intentionally teaching others how to behave (Barnett, 1968; Ewer, 1969; Galef & Dalrymple, 1978) and in the extent to which we acquire motor skills by observing and then imitating our more accomplished fellows (Davis, 1973; Galef, 1988b; Roberts, 1941; Thorpe, 1963).  However, it is only recently that evidence supporting even these relatively simple statements about differences in the processes supporting social learning by members of our own and other species has become available.  For many decades, the processes used by animals and by humans to learn socially were assumed to be identical. 

   Did It All Begin With Gall?  

   Late in the first half of the 19th century, Franz Gall, father of phrenology, quoted with approval the following passage from the works of the French philosopher and naturalist Charles-George Leroy to show that animals (in this case foxes), like humans, used arbitrary sounds, "verbal language" (Gall, 1835, p.26), to communicate ideas and emotions: 

  It is certain from observation, that before having been able to instruct themselves by personal experience, the young foxes on leaving the burrow, for the first time, are more distrustful, and more cautious in the places where war is often made on them, than in places where the snares have never been spread.  This observation, which is incontestable, proves absolutely the need they have of language; for, without it, how could they acquire the knowledge of proper precautions, which knowledge supposes a succession of facts known, of comparisons made, of judgments rendered?  It appears then, that it is absurd to doubt, that brutes have among them a language, by means of which they transmit ideas, the communication of which is necessary to them. (Leroy, 1802, in Gall, 1835, p.29) 

   To the modern reader, Leroy's views on the mechanisms of animal social learning and Gall's uncritical promotion of them (assuming, for the sake of argument, that naive young foxes do, in fact, behave as Leroy asserted they do) may suggest that both gentlemen were singularly thoughtless or gullible.  It is, however, probably more reasonable to assume that the failure of Gall and of Leroy to provide a convincing explanation of the avoidance by naive, young foxes of areas containing snares arose not from thoughtlessness or gullibility, but from a lack of alternative hypotheses to explain the behaviour of foxes. 

   For the contemporary reader, aware of the existence of pheromones, in general (Wilson & Bossert, 1963), and of warning pheromones, in particular (von Frisch, 1941), or knowledgeable about the ways in which European blackbirds (Curio, Ernst, & Vieth, 1978) or rhesus monkeys (Cook, Mineka, Wolkenstein, & Laitsch, 1985) come to avoid potential predators, observations of social influences on avoidance are not evidence of an ability of animals to communicate using language.  However, if, like Gall and Leroy working in the 19th century, we today knew of no means other than language for the transmission of information between individuals, then any evidence of animal communication would serve us, as it served Leroy and Gall, as evidence of human-like speech in nonhumans.  Gall and Leroy did not lack intellectual prowess, they lacked alternative hypotheses with which to explain the behaviours in which they were interested. 

   Imitating Romanes  

   Attribution of social influences on the development of behaviour in animals to their use of language disappeared from the scientific literature in mid-19th century.  Unfortunately, explanation of social learning by animals in terms of humanlike speech was replaced by an equally misleading, equally all-encompassing explanation of social influence on behaviour that proved considerably more difficult to reject than Leroy's idea that animals talk to one another about matters of importance. 

   Darwin, Wallace, Romanes, Morgan (for much of his life), and other, lesser known naturalists of the latter half of the 19th century treated learning by imitation as the primary way in which animals acquire adaptive behaviour.  The ability of animals to learn by imitation was taken for granted.  The only question to be asked was whether the ability to imitate had been exercised in particular instances of behavioural development (Morgan, 1896, p.184). 

   Darwin's disciple and immediate intellectual heir in behavioural matters, George Romanes, was particularly quick to infer that animals were capable of "intelligent perception of the desirability of modification [in behaviour] on the part of certain individuals and to modify their actions accordingly" (Romanes, 1884, p.229).  According to Romanes (p.219), "with animals as with men, original ideas are not always forthcoming at the time they are wanted, and therefore it is often easier to imitate than to invent." 

   Indeed, whenever Romanes (1882, 1884) saw evidence of social influences on learning in animals - whether in groups of newly hatched chicks learning to drink water, weanling lambs avoiding ingestion of toxic plants, or the acquisition of responses by birds of one species to the warning cries of another - he attributed the adaptive modifications of behaviour he described to learning by imitation.  When a cat, resident in Romanes's household, learned to open the garden gate by jumping up and grabbing hold of the latchguard with one forepaw, depressing the thumb piece with the other, and simultaneously kicking at the gate post with her hind legs, Romanes (1882) assumed: first, that the cat had observed humans opening the gate by grasping the handle and moving the latch, second, that the cat had reasoned "If a hand can do it, why not a paw?" (Romanes, 1882, p.422), and, finally, that the cat, motivated by this insight, had attempted to open the garden gate and succeeded. 

   Introspection had convinced Romanes (1882) that much of human behaviour was learned by imitation.  Anthropomorphic inference led Romanes to generalize his introspections to explain acquisition of novel behaviours by animals, as he had explained acquisition of novel behaviours by members of his own species, in terms of learning by imitation (see Galef, 1988c, for further discussion). 

   Constraints on the Study of Animal Learning  

   In the century since Romanes (1882, 1884) published his classic volumes on comparative psychology, the anthropomorphism so common in 19th-century monographs on animal behaviour has been purged from the literature.  Discussions of animal intentions and intelligent perceptions have been replaced by analyses in terms of stimuli, responses, and reinforcers.  This reductionist approach to the analysis of behaviour, advocated by Morgan, Thorndike, and Watson, profoundly influenced not only interpretations of the results of animal learning studies but also their methods and subject matter.  Anecdotal reports of cats and dogs learning complex motor skills by imitating their masters have been superceded by controlled experiments analyzing the factors influencing association formation in laboratory situations.  The resultant changes in the focus of studies of animal learning generally, and of animal social learning particularly, have proven a major advance.  However, as is often the case, progress was not entirely without cost. 

   The introduction, early in the present century, of experimental procedures for investigating association formation resulted in a precipitous shift in the subject matter of animal development studies.  Interest in the development of behaviours exhibited by animals outside the laboratory (the centre of attention since the time of Aristotle) waned.  Conversely, study of laboratory situations in which abstract processes of association formation could best be observed and dissected increased dramatically.  This shift in locus of attention had a profound impact on the study of social learning by animals.  Following Thorndike's (1898) explicit rejection, on theoretical grounds, of the possibility of learning by imitation in animals and failure both by Thorndike (1898) and by numerous other laboratory workers (see Holmes, 1911; Warden & Jackson, 1935; and Washburn, 1908 for reviews) to find convincing evidence of animal imitation, discussions of learning by imitation gradually disappeared from the behavioural literature.  Such discussions were replaced by attempts to analyze instances of social learning, demonstrated in laboratory situations, as special cases of either classical or discriminant operant conditioning (for examples see Church, 1968; Miller & Dollard, 1941).  Study of particular instances of apparent social learning observed outside the laboratory seemed unnecessary; in time, all instances of behaviour acquisition, whether individually or socially based, would be explicable in terms of general laws describing all association formation. 

   Meanwhile, in the world outside the learning laboratory, ducklings continued to follow their mothers, song birds went on singing their species-typical songs, and weaning animals continued to choose the same foods to eat as their more experienced fellows.  The psychological community simply didn't pay attention to such occurrences.  Those learning phenomena that could be explained easily within the framework provided by laboratory learning paradigms received careful study by numerous investigators.  Those instances of animal learning that were more difficult to assimilate into either of the prevailing laboratory paradigms were largely ignored.  Experimental, animal psychologists lost interest in carrying out analyses of instances of animal learning observed outside the laboratory, at least in part because successful study of learning in unconstrained situations required an approach quite different both from the informal anthropomorphizing of 19th-century naturalists and from the paradigm-bound examination of associative processes that dominated the study of animal learning. 

   An Alternative Zeitgeist  

   The development by European ethologists of a complementary framework to that provided by experimental psychology for the study of animal behaviour, in general, and animal learning, in particular, provided the background for a resurgence of interest in the study of behaviours that occurred outside the laboratory.  Ethologists studied behaviours exhibited by members of particular species in interaction with their respective natural environments.  Observations of such naturally occurring behaviours served ethologists as a focus for subsequent developmental, causal, and functional analyses.  Consequently, analyses of the behavioural processes supporting particular instances of social learning observed in natural circumstances fit easily into ethologically oriented research programmes. 

   Further, ethologists were more eclectic than experimental psychologists in discussing processes supporting the acquisition of behaviour; ethologists had no particular commitment to operant or classical paradigms as explanatory systems; and they felt no compulsion to study animal learning in situations where it might occur "free from the helping hand of instinct" (Thorndike, 1911, p.30).  On the contrary, ethologists treated learning as an adjunct to instinctive behavioural sequences (Tinbergen, 1951). 

   Although ethologists both promoted analyses of the development of behaviours observed in uncontrolled environments and maintained an eclectic approach to the study of behaviour acquisition, they lacked a tradition of sophistication and rigour in the analysis of behavioural development, in general, and of animal learning, in particular.  Of course, experimental psychologists had spent decades developing techniques that ethology lacked for the study of acquisition processes in animals.  Hence, by the mid-1960s, the elements of a hybrid ethopsychological framework were available that permitted focus on the question of how naturally occurring behaviours might develop and that provided methods needed to arrive at satisfying answers.  In particular, the question of how animals might use information acquired from others to guide their own behaviour in adaptive directions, a question that, at least implicitly, had been perplexing scientists for the better part of 2 centuries, was finally open to systematic investigation.  The issue was no longer whether animals could imitate, but, rather, how one individual might use the behaviour of others to bias its own development in appropriate directions (Galef, 1989d). 

  PART 2: A PROGRAMME OF RESEARCH 

   For the past 20 years, my co-workers and I have been studying the role of social interaction in the development of adaptive patterns of food selection by Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus).  The immediate goal of this research programme has been to determine the behavioral processes that cause one rat to direct its feeding behaviour towards the same foods that others of its social group are eating and ignore potential foods that others of its social group are not eating.  Equally important, we hoped to develop a general approach to studies of social learning that would be of use to future investigators of analogous behavioral phenomena.  

   My co-workers and I began, as any ethologist would, with field observations of a possible case of social learning.  We brought the behavioral phenomenon observed in the field into the laboratory and, as any psychologist would, then tried to determine under controlled conditions how one animal influenced another's behaviour.  

   Problems Poisoning Norway Rats  

   More than 40 years ago, an applied ecologist who was an expert in the control of Norway rats discovered that when he used a single poison bait in a rat-infested area for several months, despite initial success, later acceptance of the bait was negligible.  As might be expected, many members of the target population died as the result of eating the poisoned bait.

    The Object-Line Effect: Is It Attributable to Intercontext Differences or the Structural Properties of Contexts and Task Demands? 
  Bruce Earhard 
  Dalhousie University  

    ABSTRACT   
 Briefly presented target lines are reported more accurately when part of an object-like context than alone (Williams & Weisstein, 1978).  Efforts to explain this effect have tended to focus on structural properties that contexts must possess in order to be effective in facilitating target-line discrimination (e.g., Weisstein, Williams, & Harris, 1982).  Enns and Prinzmetal (1984) take issue with this approach.  They propose that contexts differ more from one another than do target lines presented alone, and it is this fact, and not the general structural properties of contexts, that underlies their effectiveness.  Two experiments examined intercontext differences and structural factors as determinants of context effectiveness.  Subjects were found to use intercontext differences to narrow the range of possible alternatives, but when this factor was controlled, structural properties determined context effectiveness.  The structural interpretation of context effectiveness was found not to be as straightforward as generally assumed, however.  A third experiment showed context effectiveness to be affected by the character of the discrimination task employed. 

   RESUME  Des lignes-cibles presentees brievement sont rapportees avec plus de precision lorsqu'elles font partie d'un contexte figural que presentees toutes seules (Williams & Weisstein, 1978).  Les efforts pour expliquer cet effet se sont concentres sur les proprietes structurales que le contexte doit posseder en vue de faciliter la discrimination lignes-cibles (e.g., Weisstein, Williams, & Harris, 1982).  Enns et Prinzmetal (1984) ont considere cette approche.  Ils proposent que les contextes different plus l'un de l'autre que les lignes-cibles presentees seules et c'est ce fait, et non pas les proprietes structurales generales des contextes, qui sous-tend leur efficacite.  Deux experiences examinaient les differences intercontextes et les facteurs structuraux comme determinants de l'efficacite du contexte.  On a montre que les sujets utilisaient les differences intercontexts pour retrecir l'etendue des alternatives possibles; cependant, quand ce facteur etait controle, les proprietes structurales determinaient l'efficacite du contexte.  L'interpretation structurale de l'efficacite du contexte n'etait cependant pas aussi evidente que generalement assume.  Une troisieme experience a montre que l'efficacite du contexte etait affectee par le caractere de la tache discriminative employee.  

   Briefly presented line segments can be discriminated more accurately within an object-like context than alone (Williams & Weisstein, 1978).  This finding has been termed the object-line effect (OLE).  It has attracted much attention because it is contrary to expectation.  Normally, briefly exposed, adjacent line segments interfere with one another through lateral inhibitory processes (Breitmeyer, 1984).  Line segments, therefore, should be more accurately discriminated when presented alone than when included as one of many line segments constituting a context. 

   Not all contexts are effective in facilitating line discrimination.  Weisstein and her associates have shown that contexts which are coherent (i.e., present a unitary configuration), connected (i.e., have a continuous contour), and three dimensional (i.e., have a depth inducing perspective) are effective in facilitating discrimination of constituent line detail, and contexts lacking these characteristics are not (e.g., Lanze, Maguire, & Weisstein, 1985; Lanze, Weisstein, & Harris, 1982; Weisstein, Williams, & Harris, 1982; Williams & Weisstein, 1978).  Weisstein and her associates suggest that structural properties such as coherence, connectedness, and three dimensionality increase the discriminability of contexts and allow them to be processed more rapidly than contexts lacking these properties or target lines presented alone. 

   An alternative interpretation of the OLE has been recently advanced by Enns and Prinzmetal (1984).  They suggest that in analyzing the OLE, attention should not be focused on the structural properties of contexts, but on the degree to which contexts differ from one another in appearance and the degree to which such differences are greater than those evident among target lines presented alone.  They contend that, in studies demonstrating an OLE, contexts containing target lines differ more from one another than do members of the set of target lines presented alone.  Since each different context is associated with a particular target-line location, subjects can use the distinctive appearance of individual contexts as a basis for inferring which target line has been presented.  Under such circumstances, better performance is to be expected when target lines are presented within contexts than when they are presented alone.  The feasibility of the Enns and Prinzmetal approach has been much strengthened by their demonstration that intercontext dissimilarity, in the absence of any general configural property such as three dimensionality, connectedness, or coherence, can generate an OLE and that making information provided by intercontext differences difficult to use reduces or eliminates the OLE. 

   The research to be reported examines the Enns and Prinzmetal (1984) position.  It was prompted by doubts that the effectiveness of a given set of contexts can be wholly attributed to intercontext differences.  The principal objective was to determine whether context effects attributable to the stimulus properties of contexts can be demonstrated if intercontext configural dissimilarities are controlled. 

  EXPERIMENT 1 

   Experiment 1 was a preliminary study with two objectives.  One objective was to examine Enns and Prinzmetal's (1984) claim that subjects use intercontext differences correlated with target-line location to specify acceptable alternatives in studies of the OLE.  The other objective was to try and determine whether, with intercontext differences controlled, evidence could be obtained to show that the structural properties of contexts remain as an important determinant of the OLE. 

   Method  

   Design and Materials: Subjects were required to specify the position of a broken target line presented alone and within two structurally different types of contexts.  The two different types of contexts are shown in Panel A of Figure 1.  It may be seen that each of the contexts was aligned in two different ways.  At each alignment, only two of the four broken target-line locations were appropriate targets.  If the long axis of either context was aligned vertically, a target line could be located on the left or the right.  If the long axis of either context was aligned horizontally, the target line could occur at the top or bottom.  Context alignment was thus correlated with target-line location.  If subjects are as sensitive to configural variations in contexts as Enns and Prinzmetal (1984) suggest, they should readily discern the consequences of context orientation and utilize this information to narrow down the range of appropriate response alternatives.  As a consequence, they should make few errors that involve alternatives inappropriate with respect to the orientation of a given context. 

   Although the orientation information provided by the two contexts is identical, the two contexts are very different structurally.  One context is flat and unconnected, the other is connected and three dimensional.  If Weisstein is correct and the structural properties of contexts is an important determinant of the OLE, then the connected, three-dimensional context should generate an OLE effect and the flat, unconnected context should not.  Further, any differences generated should not be attributable to intercontext differences correlated with target-line locations of the type described by Enns and Prinzmetal (1984).  Employing a single connected, three-dimensional context and a single flat, unconnected context, rather than a set of different contexts exemplifying each context type, eliminates intercontext configural differences of the type described by Enns and Prinzmetal.  The only variation in context appearance in both connected three-dimensional and unconnected two-dimensional forms is that associated with orientation, and variations associated with orientation are identical for both types of contexts.  Any overall difference between lines presented in context and alone should reflect the ease or difficulty subjects have in determining the position of target-line locations as a function of the structural properties of the two contexts employed. 

   An Imagewriter printer directed by an Apple 2e computer was used to generate the central square of three-dimensional contexts and to introduce broken target lines at the requisite positions.  Angular wing-like appendages were added by a Koh-I-Nor drafting pen with a 0.6 mm nib.  The number and length and type of the line components used in the unconnected, flat context were the same as those used in the three-dimensional context, and the positioning of broken target lines vis a vis the fixation point in outer locations of the unconnected context was identical to that used in the three-dimensional context.  The connected and unconnected contexts subtended visual angles of 2.3 and 2.1, respectively, along the long axis and 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, along the short axis.  Target lines subtended a visual angle of 1.1.  Eight naive subjects participated in the experiment in exchange for course credit points. 

   Procedure: A forced choice procedure required subjects to specify the position of the target line after each presentation by pointing to one of the four possible target-line locations displayed on a response card.  Twenty-four item presentation blocks were used, and within each block, target lines appeared alone and in each of the two different contexts equally often.  Both context orientations and all four target-line locations were sampled equally often within each block.  Drawings of various contexts and lines examined were provided before the start of the study and were available for consultation throughout the experiment.  No information was provided about the fact that horizontal and vertical alignments of contexts could be used to narrow the range of relevant target-line locations.  To familiarize subjects with the general procedure, a block of practice presentations preceded the eight blocks of experimental presentations.  A Gerbrands two-field tachistoscope was used to present stimuli.  A uniformly illuminated preexposure field containing a small fixation dot preceded and followed the exposure field.  As in the Enns and Prinzmetal (1984) study, subjects were required to maintain a predetermined level of accuracy in responding.  The required accuracy level of 50-70% correct responding was established by holding the illumination level of the exposure field of the tachistoscope fixed at 1.7 cd/m2 and varying the illumination level of the uniform field preceding and following the exposure field.  The preliminary practice period was used to establish an appropriate performance level.  As in the Enns and Prinzmetal study, further adjustments were made, if necessary, only at the end of a presentation block after all conditions had been presented an equal number of times.  The mean level of illumination of the field which preceded and followed the exposure field was 3.1 cd/m2.  A fixed exposure duration of 20 ms was used throughout the study.  Subjects were provided no feedback with respect to the accuracy of their responses during the study. 

   Results  

   To determine whether typically observed object-line effects were evident, the proportion of presentations on which target lines were designated correctly was tabulated for each condition.  The mean proportion of target lines correctly specified was higher for target lines within the connected, three-dimensional context than within the flat, unconnected context or than when presented alone (.82, .59, & .55, respectively).  An analysis of variance applied to arc sine transformed proportions indicated that presentation conditions differed reliably, F (2, 14) = 13.46, p Planned comparison tests showed that target lines were discerned significantly more accurately in the three-dimensional context than in the two-dimensional context, t(14) = 4.81, p  Differences in the accuracy with which target lines were discriminated in the flat, two-dimensional context and line-alone condition did not differ reliably. 

  

   Finding that the two contexts differed in the degree to which they facilitated target-line location supports the Weisstein et al. (1982) position that structural properties of contexts are important, but is difficult to reconcile with the approach of Enns and Prinzmetal (1984).  According to Enns and Prinzmetal, pronounced intercontext configural differences have to be evident among the exemplars of a given context type, and these differences have to be correlated with target-line locations for variations in context effectiveness to be manifest.  In the present study, each context type was represented by a single configuration.  The only variation in contexts correlated with target-line location was that associated with context alignment, and that, as has been noted, was identical for both context types. 

   To determine whether subjects took advantage of context alignment to narrow the range of appropriate alternatives, the total number of errors made by each subject were divided according to whether the alternative selected matched the orientation of the target line presented or was nonmatching, that is, orthogonal to the orientation the target line presented.  An analysis of variance carried out on the error data indicated that there were reliable main effects for error type, F (1, 7) = 5.67, p The summary of error data provided in Table 1 shows that the most important factor contributing to the interaction is the marked difference in error patterns between the context and line-alone conditions.  In context conditions, errors involving appropriately oriented alternatives were more common than errors involving inappropriately oriented alternatives, whereas in the line-alone condition the reverse was true.  Why errors involving inappropriately oriented alternatives were twice as frequent in the line-alone condition (19.63 vs. 9.50) as errors involving appropriately oriented alternatives is difficult to understand.  Inspection of presentation sequences and tabulation operations reveals no indication of anomalies that could account for the effect.  Although not readily explained, the distribution of error types in the line-alone condition is of only limited interest.

    Preface 

   This book is about the political belief systems of new elites, the youth elites of the 1980s, in the Anglo-American democracies - the old states.  The similarities and differences among and between the political cultures of Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States have been probed, debated, re-examined, and debated again for more than half a century.  In the 1960s, newly developed cross-national survey techniques produced evidence that added fuel to those speculations.  Remarkably, however, no cross-national attitudinal research comparing all five countries followed the path-breaking studies of the 1960s.  This study aims to go some distance towards filling that gap, and the argument it proposes is a simple one.  Enormous changes swept across all advanced industrial states during the last two decades.  The Anglo-American democracies, like other countries, experienced the globalization of their economies, the information revolution, profound structural transformations, and dramatic shifts in population replacement.  Long-standing patterns of political behaviour eroded, traditional alliances unravelled, and new issues forced their way onto political agendas.  The ideological climate of the 1980s, we suggest, bore little resemblance to the ideological climate of the 1960s and, for a variety of reasons, those shifts in ideology were disproportionately concentrated in the ranks of the new generations.  In what respects, then, are the political belief systems of new elites in the Anglo-American democracies similar?  In what respects are they different?  These are the questions we ask, and we answer them with comparative cross-national survey evidence from all five countries. 

   This book is written with a broad audience in mind.  Our aim is to make the results of the study accessible to those without formal training in quantitative methods and to those who are being introduced to, or who have a general interest in, the contemporary politics of the Anglo-American democracies.  Where possible, we present our findings by way of graphic illustrations.  Where we resort to summary statistical presentation of evidence, we rely on relatively few simple measures, which are explained in the text.  Our hope is that this study will contribute to a revitalized debate about politics both in and between each of the five countries as well as about the transformation of advanced industrial states in general. 

   This project was truly a collaborative effort.  We drew heavily upon the goodwill of many colleagues and institutions in all of the five countries represented in the study.  We are happy to be able to acknowledge publicly our gratitude for their help. 

   The study was ten years in the making.  In the late 1970s, while orchestrating the Cross National Survey Project, Sidney Verba co-ordinated a number of brainstorming sessions at the Center for International Affairs, Harvard University, dealing with the opportunities, difficulties, and practicalities of cross-national survey research.  It was during those stimulating meetings that the prospect of undertaking a comparative Anglo-American study was first discussed.  This project would never have been started, undertaken, or completed without the intellectual leadership and moral support of Sidney Verba.  We thank him for allowing us to use the American data for this project.  More importantly, we are very grateful for his continual encouragement. 

   Several other institutions and individuals were also crucial to the project.  The Australian field work was conducted from the Australian National University at both Canberra and Darwin.  The University of Essex gave us work space from which we co-ordinated the British segment of the study.  Tony King, Ian Budge, and Ivor Crewe were very gracious hosts.  Nigel Roberts and Rod Alley made the New Zealand component of the study possible.  And in Canada we were willingly aided in a variety of ways by colleagues across the country.  We particularly appreciate the contributions of Herman Bakvis, Andre Blais, Marsha Chandler, Jean Crete, Barry Kay, Richard Johnston, and Richard Simeon.  Some of the analysis was undertaken at the Center for Political Studies, University of Michigan.  Sam Barnes and Ronald Inglehart made that workspace a home. 

   The project placed a unique burden on our own institution, the University of Calgary. For steering us through a maze of computing related matters we are grateful to Thomas Huang and Ted Ziajka.  We were very lucky to have extremely able research assistants: Robert Burge got the project underway and Lori Galbraith held it together, carrying the bulk of the computational and graphics work through to its conclusion.  We are very appreciative of their efforts and abilities.  We also thank our colleagues in the department of political science for their congenial support. 

   The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada provided the financial wherewithal for the project (SSHRC grant #410-88-0221).  We thank them not only for underwriting the hard costs but also for providing sabbatical leave fellowships that enabled us to conduct the field work and to start attacking the analysis.  Several individuals provided us with constructive criticism of the early drafts of various parts of the book.  Seymour Martin Lipset, Paul Sniderman, and Sylvia Bashevkin were particularly helpful.  Robert Boardman, Jon Pammett, and Campbell Sharman read the entire manuscript and provided both thoughtful commentary and a number of helpful suggestions.  We are very grateful to them, and to Richard Teleky, managing editor of Oxford University Press, who coaxed us along with the manuscript. 

   Both of us borrowed time from our families.  We extend a special thanks to Susan Bloch-Nevitte and Isabel Gibbins, who were understanding when we fell short on what we imagine to be the normal responsibilities of spouses in normal families.

   CHAPTER ONE  
  Ideological Change in the Anglo-American Democracies 

  Introduction 

   This study examines the nature of political belief systems in the five Anglo-American democracies - Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States.  Perhaps no other five countries in the industrialized world are more alike; they share not only roughly comparable economies, social structures, and cultural environments, but also the same political tradition.  Compared with other industrially advanced states, each of the Anglo-American democracies has a long history of open, stable, and liberal democratic style of government.  For the most part, citizens of the Anglo-American democracies view their systems of government as legitimate, and the transfer of power has rarely taken place in an atmosphere of crisis; it has been routine.  Throughout this century political contests have not been battles about the rules of the game; instead, the battles have been about ideas, policies, leaders, and parties. 

   It is not surprising, then, that comparative social scientists often regard the Anglo-American democracies as a special subset of advanced industrial states, a distinct analytic category.  This practice gained considerable momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s with the publication of such landmark works as Louis Hartz's Founding of New Societies, Alexander Brady's Democracy in the Dominions, Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba's Civic Culture, and Robert Alford's Party and Society.  These studies, along with a number of influential articles by Seymour Martin Lipset, Gabriel Almond, and others, all underscored the same point: Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States were all 'different examples of the same type'.  Some scholars emphasized the remarkably similar 'climate' or 'spirit' of politics in the five states.  Others identified secularism and homogeneity as the unifying themes, while yet others pointed up similarities in styles of political combat and political values - pluralism, pragmatism, individualism, and the non-ideological sense of compromise.  The language differed but the message was the same - all five countries shared a common political culture beyond what one might expect from their similar status as Western industrialized states. 

   By the middle of the 1960s, however, the conceptual tide turned.  Armies of scholars drawing upon a variety of analytical traditions, and working from national rather than cross-national perspectives, challenged the notion that the Anglo-American democracies were 'essentially the same'.  The historical vineyards were re-worked to show that 'significant differences' existed, and could be traced to variations in founding traditions.  Variations in political institutions, social structures, and literary traditions were probed to bolster the case for the essential differences between national political cultures.  Canadian scholars, for example, reacting perhaps to concerns about the 'Americanization' of Canadian culture, entered the fray contending that the differences between Canadian and American values were not 'mere nuances', but fundamental.  American analysts, meanwhile, busily mounted a powerful and incidentally complementary case for American exceptionalism.  Throughout the Anglo-American democracies, the effort and conclusions focused on contrasts, not similarities. 

   Today the friction between these two visions persists, and in the final analysis it hinges on one central empirical question: Are there significant differences between and among the contemporary political cultures of the five Anglo-American democracies?  Certainly there are countless national arguments to support, for example, the expectation that the political culture of Australia will differ significantly from that of Britain, and that of Britain from the political culture of the United States.  For readers and scholars in those countries whose main concern is to explain national political cultures to domestic populations, idiosyncratic features are often to be treasured and vigorously defended.  At the same time, however, we have compelling reasons to expect cultural similarity.  The Anglo-American democracies not only share the structural characteristics common to all industrial states; they also share a common political tradition.  Thus the expectation of similarity is driven not only by more general patterns of structural and ideological convergence within the Western world, but also by history.  At root, however, remains the basic empirical question: Are there significant national differences in political culture?  Until and unless such differences can be demonstrated, it is premature to speculate on the reasons why national differences might persist in an era of global ideological convergence. 

   Methodological Overview  

   Our entry into this debate about cross-national similarities and differences in political values is shaped by three themes that regularly emerge in these disputes.  First, we accept, of course, that competing interpretations of the same phenomena are a normal part of academic debate in all disciplines, as are attempts to resolve discrepancies of interpretation.  In this instance, for example, it might be argued that the differences between the two visions of the Anglo-American democracies can be squared away simply by acknowledging that each operates at a different level of generalization.  After all, what appears close up to be an 'important difference' easily fades into insignificance when global comparisons are entertained.  Australians and Canadians might be expected to be alert and sensitive to differences between the two countries, whereas an observer from Africa could be excused for emphasizing their similarities (climatic differences notwithstanding!).  But that line of reasoning is not entirely convincing either, because it obscures the fact that much of the debate centres around the same unit of observation - national values - and that the empirical question still remains as to whether or not significant differences exist. 

   Second, most comparative judgements about values in the five Anglo-American democracies rely almost entirely upon indirect evidence.  National differences in crime rates, for example, might be used to speculate on the importance of citizen deference to political elites in the civic cultures of the countries under examination.  However, forming conclusions about contemporary public attitudes on the basis of inherited political institutions and social patterns is risky and contentious.  It is equally hazardous to rely on a theory about founding traditions to make inferences about the national values of populations several generations removed from founding circumstances.  The problem is that to get from institutional, social structural, literary, and historical evidence to conclusions about national values in the 1980s and beyond requires a logical leap of faith.  Many of the existing studies that rely on these impressionistic sources are both imaginative and persuasive, but they do not escape the limitations of having to rely on inference.  This debate about comparative similarities and differences has raged now for more than twenty-five years, during which time comparative social scientists have continued to use the Anglo-American democracies as a major analytic category.  From that standpoint, it is remarkable that no single study has ever provided direct comparative evidence of national values in all five countries. 

   Third, and relatedly, if claims to the effect that the Anglo-American democracies share 'essentially the same political values' ring hollow in the absence of direct evidence of those similarities, then so do counterclaims about national uniqueness.

      EDUCATIONAL CHANGE  
   CAN WE MAKE SENSE OF REALITY? 
   by Rod A. Wickstrom 

   WARREN BENNIS, in his recent book,  Why Leaders Can't Lead , has suggested that: 

     In the 1960s, we wanted to make the world better.  In the 1970s, we wanted only to make ourselves better.  Now, at the start of the 1990s, we seem to be uncertain about whether we can make anything better.   1    1. Warren Bennis,  Why Leaders Can't Lead  (San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1990), p. xiii.     

   Clearly, such a negative view of pos  sibilities has not prevailed on the edu  cational scene over the past decade.  Indeed, education has been bombarded with a staggering variety of proposed changes in recent years.  Consider a few examples:

 &bullet; One writer suggested that the way to correct the  "dismal failure"  of Canada's education system is to refuse anyone a driver's license until high school is completed. 

 &bullet; Several provinces have moved toward increased amalgamation of school districts as a means of improving effi  ciency. 

&bullet; Singer Joni Michell is reported to have suggested at an arts education con  ference that the way to produce more artists is to discourage them. 

&bullet; One of the restructuring initiatives undertaken in a U.S. school included the local decision to operate with no princi  pal, but instead have five management leaders and 17 committees. 

&bullet; Japanese educational authorities, long characterized in this century as operating the  "model"  education system, are seriously reviewing North American education because they are concerned about the lack of creativity developed in Japanese schools.

&bullet; In South Carolina, the state has tried providing  "bonuses"  to schools exhibiting good standardized test scores. 

&bullet; And in the United Kingdom, long considered a bastion of local school autonomy in curriculum, the central authority has moved toward a national curriculum. 

   Virtually every western nation and every Canadian province is undergoing some form of educational reform.  The real challenge for many becomes one of understanding these proposals, many of which seem contradictory and some simply ludicrous. 

   The way we make sense out of expe  rience is, of course, very individual.  The intent of this article is to share the writer's  "cognitive maps,"  in the hope that readers might better understand current developments and inform themselves for more effective practice.  Any such attempt would seem to require an indica  tion of the reasons for action or change, the nature of proposed changes, and the methods of implementing change. 

    The reasons for change  

   The voices of demand for improve  ment in our schools are many, varied, and increasingly insistent, but they can probably be grouped under two main headings. 

    Internal  - From within the educational establishment itself - classrooms, schools, districts, professional associa  tions, universities - come many of these pressures for change. 

   Partly, this relates to our knowledge base, which has been growing and deve  loping.  The practical realities that teachers face from day to day (for example, the recognition of just how diffi  cult it is to motivate the unwilling learner or to make learning meaningful to students who are subject to so much stimuli) provide much cause for the search for better approaches. 

   Add to this the theoretical contribu  tions to our knowledge base.  The increas  ed understanding from cognitive psycho  logy of how we must place new learning into our own individual meaningful  "whole"  or context, or the recognition of Piagetian developmental stages, are examples of knowledge that place demands on us for change. 

   But we also deal constantly with the awareness of unrealized expectations in education.  For how many decades have we known that elementary school science should be a much richer experience for students, yet we've managed to change so little?  If critical thinking has been a goal of education for the past half century, why does there seem to be so little evidence of its presence in everyday life? 

    External  - To these voices from within education must be added many external concerns. 

   Economic realities play a very important part in these external demands.  Not only do we face stress from dimishing public resources for education, but the economic environment has changed to the point where there is little place left for the unskilled in our society.  So we hear strident voices crying over a dropout rate that would have been consi  dered unimaginably good a few decades ago.  Can the schools actually develop in all students a level of skill and knowledge which not long ago was required only of the relatively few?  Or can we appro  priately increase our  graduates'  problem-solving ability as necessary in a com  plicated post-industrial society? 

   And then, of course, we have the pressures of social changes.  The list seems endless: sexually transmitted diseases, drugs, violence, family and community breakdown, a more scienti  fically and technically based workplace - all demand the school's attention. 

    The nature of proposed changes  

   The demands for change identified above do not lead to a single conclusion.  In fact, they not only become mixed, indistinct, and unclear, but often exist in some tension.  The need for the school to  Table Figure 1  be a warm, caring place where students can find comfort from the fractured home or community in which they exist, for example, is not necessarily compatible with the need for more effort, and a more harshly competitive economic climate.  Similarly, the pressures for reduced drop-out rates may conflict with demands that all students have a higher level of tech  nical and scientific literacy.  And the diffe  rent  "mixtures"  of these demands can produce greatly variant conceptions of what the school should be. 

   One useful approach is to consider these different pictures of education metaphorically.  At least seven metaphors depicting the changed school as it  "should be"  seem common.  They are shown in Figure 1. 

     The Factory   

   One picture of the  "new school"  is presented as follows: 

     If we expect children to participate fully and equally in this democratic society, they must learn a  common, shared foundation  of knowledge, as well as certain  common beliefs  and standards of conduct  [Emphasis added].  2    2.   A Legacy for Leaners: The Report  of the  Royal Commission on Education  (Victoria, BC 1988), p. 94.     

   Clearly, this is a picture of the Factory - a place where the emphasis is on pro  ductivity, uniformity and quality control.  And although educators may recoil at the coldness of that picture, they also would find it difficult to disagree with the need for common learning and a guarantee of success. 

   A modification of this metaphor is heard in the vision of a  "technological laboratory".   This is still an uncommon view, but increasingly the school of the future is pictured as one dominated by computerized learning, with well-programmed software leading all students, on an individualized basis, to mastery of essential skills and knowledge. 

     The Department Store   

   In a department store, or a large con  vention, we can pick and choose accord  ing to our interests.  Another quote from the same source suggests that: 

    ...the larger challenge for the provincial system rests in attempting to establish what one scholar describes as  "a system of plurality of excellence"  ... a variety of career paths in formal schooling leading to different types of high level competence other than academic ability.  3    3.   A Legacy for Learners: The Report of the Royal Commission on Education  (Victoria, BC: 1988), p. 104.     

   Clearly this metaphor places stress on variety and choice.  Indeed, in many cir  cles there are suggestions that the choice should be extended not only to students in school, but also to parents for a choice of the school their children attend. 

     The Family   

   There are few parents, when sending their first child off to the first day at school, who do not at heart wish that the school will, after all, be not that different from home - a kind of second family, where love, compassion, and co-opera  tion prevail.  And certainly that desire is echoed by many in society who see the school as too harsh, too unsuited to  students'  individual needs and aspira  tions. 

     The Garden   

   If the family metaphor comes primari  ly from parents, a closely allied picture comes mainly from educators - the view of the school as a garden (or perhaps more correctly, an  "untended meadow" ), a place where beautiful things grow at their own rate and in their own manner, if only educators provide the right conditions.  The school, according to this conception, should be characterized by growth, beauty, diversity, and interest.  Consider, for example, the words of psychologist Carl Rogers: 

     ... I turn to an activity, a purpose, which really warms me - the facilitation of learn  ing.  When I have been able to transform a group - and here I mean all the members of a group, myself included - into a community of  learners , then the excitement has been almost beyond belief.  To free curiosity; to permit individuals to go charging off in new directions dictated by their own questioning and exploration; to recognize that everything is in process of change - here is an experience I can never forget.  4    4.   Carl Rogers,  Freedom to Learn  (Columbus, OH. Charles E. Merrill Publishing, 1969).     

     The Olympics   

   One only need imagine a sportscaster ludicrously commenting on a 100-metre dash,  "That was a wonderful race, with no winners,"  to realize the nature of this image.  For the Olympics are meant, through competition, to bring out the best in competitors.  And while the stress on winners in this metaphor may seem inappropriate, with slight modification we can all see merit in a conception of school which sets hurdles and demands excellence. 

     The Freedom March   

   The vivid pictures we have seen in recent years of the masses marching for freedom in Eastern Europe or China call forth this metaphor - a picture of the school as a place for developing some passion over a worthwhile cause.  The voices raised for environmental educa  tion or Canadian identity have this common theme: school should instil in students, indeed indoctrinate them, with this intense desire to do something worth  while. 

     The Clinic   

   The medical model of a clinic, where the patient is referred for successively more sophisticated investigations and diagnostic procedures, has its reflection in an image of the school.  In this view, present in the  "cascade"  model of special education services, for example, the school should be characterized by much more precision, as we seek to find the problem in someone's inability to learn, and to fix it. 

   The purpose in describing these vary  ing concepts of the school is not to denigrate any.  Indeed, each has some validity in responding to some of the demands for change.  But we should note that these views are often in conflict.  The result, once again, is part of the tension faced in schools, at the board table, and in communities. 

    A framework  

   At this point, a digression is necessary to outline a framework presented by John Ingalls.  5    5. J. D. Ingalls,  Human Energy  (Don Mills, ON: Addison-Wesley, 1976), pp. 9-18.   Ingalls has suggested that people have two major categories of needs, which in turn lead to two major types of behaviour.  Type A Behaviours he identi  fies as those which represent the basic human  need for certainty , while Type B Behaviours are those representing a capacity for tolerating  ambiguity or uncer  tainty .  A brief description of each is con  tained in Figure 2. 

    Ingalls'  major point is that both types of behaviour are normal, natural, and universal and, in fact, are required in our society.  Type A Behaviours, which express our needs for certainty, are the basis for all rationality.  They are, in fact, behaviours of control which represent our efforts to  "make sense of things,"  and hence they diminish the degree of free  dom and spontaneity which exists.  Type B Behaviours, on the other hand, tend to be very accepting, and hence reduce conflict; however, if they alone are present, they would make any concerted effort virtually impossible. 

   One can speculate that just as such behaviours are natural and necessary for individuals, so are they for organizations.  Both types of behaviour, for example, can be considered essential in school systems.  One type is ideally suited to obtaining maximum information which is a requir  ed condition for effective problem-solving.  The other enables some consis  tent and co-ordinated effort toward common goals. 

   This framework can be applied to the variant metaphors or conceptions of the school.  Certainly it seems reasonable to suggest that the concepts underlying metaphors of the Factory, Olympics, and Freedom March appeal to the need for certainty, control, and consistency.  Table Figure 2   The Department Store, Garden, Family metaphors, however, present concep  tions of education that provide for beha  viours leading to ambiguity, variety, and creativity.  The clinic can respond to the need for either kind of behaviour.  

    The implementation of change  

   Although most would probably accept the internal and external factors that demand change, reaching decisions on the desirable types of change is much more of a problem.  Even if such consen  sus is reached, we also face a variety of available approaches to implementing a model of the  "new school."   

   Here again, the educational techni  ques and the leadership approaches at our disposal can be categorized under the two types of needed behaviours. 

   Some significant techniques fall under both headings.  In the interest of promot  ing greater consistency, certainty, and control, for example, we use core cur  riculum, objectives and directions, mastery learning, textbooks, and high student expectations.  Leadership ap  proaches that create a common vision, or depend upon centralized decision-making, tend to promote consistency types of behaviours as well.  

   In the interests of promoting variety, ambiguity and creativity, on the other hand, we use curricular electives, increased professional autonomy, indi  vidualization, a variety of learning materials, and student interest.  Leader  ship approaches that increase personal freedom or rely on human relations skills have similar purposes. 

   Once again, we observe a certain degree of conflict and tension between the behaviours or approaches we use to pro  mote consistency and control and those required to encourage variety and creati  vity.

  Introduction 
  SOCIOLOGY: ITS SCOPE AND CENTRAL CONCERNS 

   If one were to ask the majority of sociologists to define the scope and substance of sociology in a few sentences, they most likely would reply in something like the following terms.

  Sociology is a social science devoted to the study of human groups of all kinds and all sizes.  A group may be defined as two or more interacting individuals.  The interaction of individuals gives rise to a variety of social relations and social processes such as cooperation, competition, conflict, and domination.  The full range of human behavior and relations is the subject matter of sociology. 

   We call sociology a science because our main intellectual aim is to comprehend and explain the workings of the social world.  Like all sciences, sociology pursues truth and knowledge by employing methods of inquiry based on logic and evidence and by subjecting theories and findings to an ongoing critical examination.   

   However, the statement we have placed in the mouths of our colleagues tends to exaggerate their unity of outlook.  The differences among sociologists are often as significant as their common ground.  Some sociologists imitate the methods of the natural sciences and see themselves working in close parallel with physicists and chemists; other sociologists believe they share the aims of novelists and poets.  Between those extremes there is a wide range of research methods, techniques, ideas, and just plain notions.  Nevertheless, the several different sociologies do have something in common that may be called the sociological perspective or approach. 

   The essentials of the sociological approach are best conveyed by introducing the student to the pioneers of sociological theory and analysis who wrote in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Their works are now regarded as the classic tradition of sociological thinking because they have stood the test of time.  We refer to these writings again and again; we rely on pioneers' theoretical ideas; we employ their concepts; we continue to investigate questions they raised; and, finally, we emulate their intellectual craftsmanship.  In a word, the classic tradition provides the theoretical foundations of the sociological perspective. 

   In this introduction we cannot fully convey the intellectual riches of that tradition, nor can we dwell on the specific works and ideas of the thinkers who contributed to it.  Those are among the tasks of this book as a whole.  All we can do here is to provide a general idea of the tradition's significance. 

   Not all sociologists would agree on the thinkers to be included in the classic tradition.  Some of our colleagues would have longer lists than others.  However, most lists would have to include at least three of the masters who receive detailed consideration in this book: Emile Durkheim, Karl Marx, and Max Weber.  Although the names of these men are not likely to mean anything to the beginning student, we mention them here and postpone introducing them until the appropriate contexts in the following chapters. 

   The founders of the discipline which we today call sociology did not necessarily look upon themselves as professional sociologists.  One finds in their writings an exploration of the full scope of the human condition.  They freely availed themselves of the intellectual resources of anthropology, psychology, history, economics, and philosophy.  Today those fields of study are distinct academic disciplines with jealously guarded borders.  But for the classical sociological thinkers, academic boundaries were either nonexistent or quite fluid.  They were more interested in addressing significant questions than in remaining faithful to this or that academic area. 

   It is therefore in the spirit of the classical tradition that sociology is conceived of and introduced in this book.  Following in the footsteps of the pioneering masters, we shall try to focus attention on key questions.  In the remainder of this introduction, we merely raise some of those questions in the hope that the student will agree on their importance and look forward to addressing them. 

  QUESTIONS ADDRESSED SOCIOLOGICALLY IN THIS BOOK 

   What are the similarities and differences between humans and other living creatures?  It is true that human beings share many physiological characteristics with some other members of the animal kingdom.  But is it not also true that the human possesses something more than they do?  What does that "more" consist of? 

   A related issue is the nature of human nature.  Is the human being driven by instincts, by internal, genetically determined biopsychic forces?  Are humans innately aggressive, as Konrad Lorenz and other prestigious students of animal behavior have alleged?  Or to take an opposing but equally influential view, are humans wholly determined by external, environmental factors?  The psychologist B. F. Skinner, for example, has claimed that human beings are passive entities totally shaped by external stimuli.  For Skinner and his followers, "autonomy," "will," "mind," "self," and other forms of consciousness are just so many illusions.  Finally, there is the question raised anew in recent years by sociobiologists: How do the principles of human social organization compare with those on which animal societies are based? 

   As one shifts attention to large human organizations and societies, new theoretical problems emerge.  How does a society establish and maintain order; that is, ensure a measure of internal peace that will enable its members to attend to their vital affairs?  What is the connection between order and justice?  That question was skillfully explored by the renowned French sociologist Emile Durkheim, who noted that modern industrial society is largely based on formal contractual relations.  Contracts are often made between social unequals, where one party dominates and the other has no choice but to serve or to suffer worse consequences.  Durkheim's reply, as we shall see, raises the critical question of whether a social order resting on basic social inequalities can be stable. 

   However, the social theorist who raised that question most dramatically was Karl Marx, the well-known nineteenth-century writer whose ideas have had so much political influence in the present century.  Sociologists have increasingly recognized that Marx made significant contributions to sociological theory and analysis, especially for the study of social classes and social change.  Though Marx and Marxism are highly controversial subjects, we shall try to discuss his work objectively, with the aim of highlighting his sociological contributions. 

   Social stratification is the term sociologists employ to describe the study of inequalities based on wealth, power, prestige, and other social conditions.  Key questions are: How do basic social inequalities come about?  How are they perpetuated?  Are modern societies still structured along social-class lines?  Some sociologists favor a social-class type of analysis; others do not.  Some sociologists believe that basic social inequalities can be reduced and even eliminated.  Others insist on the necessity of social inequality, arguing that a society's social positions must be stratified and that the rights and duties associated with those positions must be unequal.  Similarly, some theorists hold that throughout history, from the dawn of civilization to the present, two classes of people have been evident: One that rules and another that is ruled.  That state of affairs has prevailed whether government has been despotic, aristocratic, democratic, or what have you.  Moreover, the division of society into rulers and ruled, those theorists maintain, is inevitable and bound to persist so long as there are human societies on earth.  We shall subject several such theories to close scrutiny.  We argue that inequalities can be reduced to a degree, although they are without doubt stubbornly persistent.  We also sketch some of the main changes that have taken place in the class structures of Canada and other societies, especially during the twentieth century, and outline some of the forces likely to cause more change in the near future. 

   One very clear manifestation of social inequality is the status of ethnic and racial minorities.  Ethnic and racial minorities the world over have continued to suffer from a variety of disabilities, including prejudice, discrimination, segregation, exploitation, and persecution.  The vastness of the subject constrains us to focus attention on minorities in Canada.  We demonstrate that race and ethnicity have roots that are more social than biological or purely cultural.  We show, moreover, that while most immigrant groups experience considerable upward mobility in Canada, certain groups, notably French and aboriginal Canadians, experience persistent inequality as conquered peoples.  Thus, we agree only in part with John Porter, one of the founding fathers of Canadian sociology, who saw Canada as a country of fewer mobility opportunities. 

   Social institutions have been central to the concerns of sociology from its very inception.  In the language of sociology, an institution is a firmly established social practice together with its accompanying form of organization.  Examples of major institutions are the family and religion.  In our discussion of the family, we shall concern ourselves mainly with the question of whether the family is in a state of decline.  We demonstrate that nuclear families (composed of a married man and woman living with children) are becoming less common all the time and now comprise only a fifth of Canadian households.  We examine a variety of factors that help account for the proliferation of family forms: the increased participation of women in the paid labor force, the increased use of various means of birth control, the increased acceptability of homosexuality, and so forth.  Paradoxically, we conclude that the family is not in a state of crisis; in our judgment the growth of various family forms yields increased freedom for family members. 

   In studying the institutions of religion, sociologists concern themselves with the connections between religious phenomena and other facets of social life.  What are the social roots of the idea of the divine?  Why is a belief in the divine found in all societies?  Why is the sacred everywhere sharply distinguished from the profane?  Is religion a positive phenomenon in that it meets certain basic social and individual needs?  Or is it injurious to humans, blinding them to reality and forestalling a rational understanding of their actual circumstances?  Is the influence of religion declining in modern society?  To shed light on those and other intriguing questions, we employ the classical writings of William James, Emile Durkheim, Bronislaw Malinowski, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, and Max Weber. 

   Besides institutions, another central concern of sociology is to understand social movements and other forms of collective behavior.  Why and how do some small groups become mass movements?  Throughout history we see evidence of concerted social action on the part of large numbers of people.  Religious, political, and other social movements appear again and again.  We analyze the rise of Naziism in Germany in the 1930s, and the growth of the farmers' and workers' movements in Canada in the twentieth century.  These case studies demonstrate how a variety of social factors - discontent, ideology, leadership, and power resources - shapes the success or failure of collective attempts to change society. 

   Another major area of sociological concern is deviant behavior or the question of why some people deviate from the norms (rules, standards, and laws) of society.  Crime is an example of deviant behavior.  What makes a person become a criminal?  Traditional nonsociological replies to that question are that a criminal is an abnormal human being afflicted with some defect that accounts for his or her deviance or that a criminal is an atavism, a kind of throwback to an earlier evolutionary stage who possesses ferocious instincts.  This last view was in fact the doctrine promoted by a well-known nineteenth-century criminologist, Cesare Lombroso. 

   However, Lombroso's younger contemporary, Durkheim, had a quite different view of the matter.  In his pioneering sociological analysis, he put forth the proposition that deviance, like conformity, is firmly rooted in social conditions.  Building on the work of Durkheim, we address such matters as how an individual becomes a criminal, the nature of lower-class criminal subcultures, the higher incidence of certain types of law violations in the American ghettos and among aboriginal Canadians, white-collar and corporate crime, and, finally, the gender distribution of crime.  How do societies change?  What processes account for the transformation of society and culture?  Urbanization, for instance, had a beginning and can be traced to the ancient Near East.  On the site of biblical Jericho, archeologists have uncovered in the oldest strata the remains of a community dating back to the eighth millennium B.C.  Those strata appear to be evidence of the earliest human settlement on record.  Another of the earliest human settlements is Jarmo, located on the foothills running along the Tigris-Euphrates plain between Iraq and Iran.  Archeological methods (carbon-14 tests) indicate that farming communities existed in that region by about 6750 B.C.  However, neither of those ancient settlements, though large and proto-urban in some respects, were true cities.  Rather, they were tangible evidence of the Neolithic Revolution, which prepared the way for genuine urbanization.

  Introduction: 
  An Overview of the Party 

   The roots of the federal New Democratic Party lie in the Great Depression of the 1930s.  In 1932, 131 delegates from a variety of organizations gathered together in Calgary and decided to form the 'Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer, Labour, Socialist)'.  A year later, the CCF held its first annual convention in Regina and drafted the Regina Manifesto, a statement of principles that is for many the touchstone of Canadian socialism.  In 1992 the New Democratic Party, the successor to the CCF, celebrates sixty years of CCF-NDP history.  Without a doubt, the party can take much pride in its political accomplishments.  But that pride is combined with serious reflection and critical self-appraisal regarding the past, and some concern about the future. 

   Is the federal NDP stalled as a third party?  Has it largely failed in its efforts to be more successful than its predecessor, the CCF?  Why, despite its image repackaging, does the NDP continue to make so little progress in Quebec?  What are the long-term prospects in the industrial heartland of Ontario?  Is the party's provincial base in the west still its main strength?  Has the NDP ceased to provide a clear socialist alternative to the two old-line parties?  Has the NDP become more a brokerage party and less an ideologically-based movement?  Why, after almost sixty years, has the NDP not made greater gains?  In providing an overview of the party, particularly during the 1980s, this chapter will suggest some preliminary answers to these questions, which will be considered in more detail in later chapters. 

  SUPPORT 

   After reaching its peak at 15.6% in 1945, the federal CCF vote dropped consistently in the four subsequent elections: to 13.4% in 1949, 11.3% in 1953, 10.7% in 1957, and 9.5% in 1958.  Like the Socialist Party of the United States, the CCF was clearly on the path to oblivion.  But the birth of the NDP gave new electoral vitality to Canada's socialist movement.  Winning 13.5% of the vote in its maiden election, in 1962, the NDP did better than had the CCF in all but one of the elections it contested.  On average, from 1962 to 1988 the federal NDP has acquired 17.2% of the vote, as compared with 11.1% for the CCF - a clear gain of 6.1%, and a 55% increase over its forerunner's record.  In seven of the ten federal elections since 1962 the NDP has gained a higher percentage of votes than the CCF did even in its best year, 1945. 

   Only once, however, has the CCF-NDP received more than 20% of the federal vote: this was in 1988, when the party exceeded its 26-year average (1962-88) in every province or region except Manitoba and Nova Scotia (see Appendix Table 1).  Although it has increasingly surpassed the 20% barrier in Gallup polls, it has not yet become a major party on the brink of power. 

   Nor, despite these overall gains, has the NDP's electoral support shown improvement over the CCF's in all regions equally.  Regionalization between and within parties is a fact of life in Canadian politics, and the CCF-NDP is no exception.  When data are compared regarding the average federal vote by province for the CCF and the NDP (see Table 1.1), we find that in Saskatchewan support has declined from 34.7% for the CCF to 32.4% for the NDP.  The biggest drop was in the years 1962-65, when the province returned no NDP MPs - the only period in the combined history of the federal CCF-NDP that this has been so.  Several factors offer explanations: (1) resentment over the transformation of the CCF into the NDP in the only province where the CCF had formed a government; (2) disappointment over T.C. Douglas's departure from Saskatchewan politics to return to Ottawa; and (3) growing disenchantment with the provincial CCF as it neared the end of its second decade of uninterrupted power. 

   In part the NDP was formed with urban, labour-oriented Ontario in mind, and it was in that province that its greatest increase in support occurred: from a 10.7% average for the CCF to a 20.0% average for the NDP.  The party has seen a virtual doubling of its Ontario vote, a seven-fold increase in the average number of seats won per election (from just over one in the CCF era to eight), and an equally large increase in the percentage of its total seats coming from that province (from 7.1% to 31.1%). 

   The old CCF was an electoral disaster in Quebec, where it averaged a mere 1.5% of the vote.  Some problems were present right from the start.  Few Francophones attended the founding convention, and the name Cooperative Commonwealth Federation did not translate well into French.  Most of Quebec's Roman Catholic population, and particularly its leadership, regarded the party as atheistic, materialistic, and anti-clerical.  In policy, moreover, the CCF stressed the need for a strong federal government and central planning at the expense of provincial powers and jurisdiction - another point on which most Quebeckers were especially sensitive.  Finally, the heavy Anglophone membership of the Quebec CCF reinforced the CCF's image as a party antithetical to French Canadian interests. 

   Another reason for the NDP's creation was to make a new and better start in Quebec.  While no significant breakthrough has yet occurred in a general election, the NDP, with an average 8.1% of the vote, has fared much better than did the CCF.  Overall, the province has given the NDP its third-largest increase in votes over the CCF, and the third-highest percentage of the party's total votes (12.5%); judging by the 1988 election, more than one in ten NDP voters are now located in Quebec.  And if the province has yet to elect a single NDP MP in a general election, the party has on two separate occasions acquired a solitary Quebec MP; once by means of a defection from the Conservatives (Robert Toupin, from 1987 until 1988) and once, more significantly, through a by-election victory (Phil Edmonston in Chambly in 1990).  Whether these small steps are indicative of potentially greater future gains for the NDP in Quebec, particularly during a general election, remains to be seen. 

   That the NDP has been better able than the CCF to establish a presence in all parts of Canada can be seen both in the greater percentage of ridings in which it has run candidates (61.3% for the CCF vs. 96.0% for the NDP) and in the fact that it has increased its vote in almost all regions of Canada (see Table 1.1).  For example, the average percentage vote for the NDP in the province in which its record has been the worst - Prince Edward Island - is still higher than the CCF's average in several provinces. 
 
   The CCF has often been portrayed as a western protest movement (e.g., Lipset, 1968: 188).  Certainly its leaders came from the west, as did the vast majority of its MPs (89.3%) (see Table 1.2).  

   With respect to total votes cast for the NDP, the more populous east (i.e., Ontario and Quebec), not surprisingly, accounts for the larger proportion: 60.5%, as compared with 39.6% from the west.  Total votes, however, are far from the only criterion.  The NDP's representation in Parliament continues to have a western orientation, with 67.3% of its seats coming from the west.  This is a lower rate than in the CCF days, but still somewhat at variance with the party's total votes.  For example, the 1988 election saw record-high NDP votes in three western provinces: 44.2% in Saskatchewan, 37.0% in British Columbia, and 17.4% in Alberta. 

   In two other important ways the NDP retains a very strong western orientation.  On the one hand, 1987 data on the 276,128 members of the party affiliated indirectly through unions (see Table 1.4) indicate that the east in general and Ontario in particular accounted for the overwhelming majority (79.5% and 76.0% respectively).  In contrast, 1987 data on direct individual members (see Table 1.5) reveal that 73.0% of these were found in the west.  To a considerable degree this may reflect the NDP's strong provincial bases in this region, since federal-party members are also simultaneously provincial-party members (except in Quebec from 1989 onwards).  Until the 1990 upset victory in Ontario, the only provinces in which the CCF-NDP had formed governments were in the west: from 1972 to 1975 in British Columbia, from 1944 to 1964 and 1971 to 1982 in Saskatchewan, from 1969 to 1977 and 1981 to 1988 in Manitoba, and from 1985 to the present in the Yukon.  Any decline in the party's provincial fortunes in the west, therefore, is likely to have an effect upon the federal party's position in terms of both membership and finances. 

   In Saskatchewan the Blakeney NDP government had been dramatically defeated in 1982.  The party received only 37.2% of the vote, its worst showing in forty-four years, and went from 44 seats to 8, the most precipitous drop ever for the provincial CCF-NDP in Saskatchewan (Fox, 1982: 682-4).  Nevertheless, a considerable NDP base remained, and in the provincial election of 1986 the party received 45.2% of the vote, a sizeable increase from 1982.  In fact, this was the highest vote for any of the parties - and higher than in 1975, when the NDP had formed the government.  But because the electoral system was weighted more heavily to the less populated rural ridings, the NDP won only 25 legislative seats (Fox, 1987: 414-15); the Conservatives, with only 44.6% of the vote but 38 seats, formed the government and stalled Allan Blakeney's attempted comeback.  It would remain for Roy Romanow, Blakeney's successor in the province that pioneered Canada's socialist programmes, to return the provincial NDP to power.  Certainly the NDP 's record-high 1988 federal vote in Saskatchewan gave renewed reason for optimism on the eve of the 1991 provincial election, which was fought on the issues of privatization, government decentralization (Pitsula and Rasmussen, 1990), and the economic plight of Prairie farmers.  Romanow was elected Premier with over 50% of the vote and a massive 55 of 66 seats.  Saskatchewan was clearly back in the NDP fold.  

   In British Columbia in the 1980s, the provincial NDP, which had formed the government under Dave Barrett from 1972 to 1975, failed twice to return to power.  However, with 44.2% of the vote in 1983, and 42.6% in 1986, down slightly from its previous high of 45.2% in 1979, the party was still in good health organizationally, and the record-high vote and seats won in the province in the 1988 federal election were promising.  The ongoing financial scandals of Bill Vander Zalm's Social Credit government and the lacklustre performance of his successor Rita Johnston contributed to the collapse of the Social Credit vote in the 1991 provincial election.  While the NDP vote itself again fell slightly to 39.8%, it was still sufficient to thwart the resurgent Liberal Party.  The NDP won 51 seats and provincial leader Mike Harcourt became Premier of British Columbia. 

   The NDP's greatest success stories in the 1980s were its two provincial victories in Manitoba.  Returning to power in 1981, the Manitoba NDP not only won the most seats in its history (34), but also received its highest vote ever (47.4%).  In 1986, despite a decline in its vote to 40.6% (second place to the Conservatives), the party retained a slim majority of seats (30, to the Conservatives' 26) and continued, albeit precariously, as the provincial government for another two years.

  Introduction 

   In 1984 Shirley Ittas, a faculty secretary in the film department at York University in Toronto, worked a 35-hour week for $15,745 per year.  Shirley's job requirements were many and complex: 

  she uses her judgement as well as her clerical skills.  There are many hectic days when students need quick responses.  In fielding inquiries, providing information about the department's regulations and courses, sorting out hundreds of portfolios and grades for evaluation, she believes she affects student's lives.  

   Shirley was paid $8.65 per hour.  The groundskeepers at York were getting $9.19 per hour.  Was Shirley being paid fairly in comparison with the groundskeepers?  She certainly didn't think so: 

  'I didn't feel angry that they [the groundskeepers] were earning a certain amount of money.  I felt angry I was paid less.  I do have a lot of responsibility and I think my contribution is as valuable as their contribution, and my salary should be at least equal ....  My job is important.' 

   PURPOSE  

   Investigation into the income differences between women and men has been dominated by three types of studies: quantitative estimations by economists and sociologists of the components of the gendered wage gap;  There have been virtually no analyses of the dynamic political struggles along class and gender lines over the formulation of legislation on equal pay for equal work, or equal pay for work of equal value. 

   The purpose of this book is to examine the three basic areas in which the political struggles over pay equity have been waged.  These are the paid capitalist workplace (offices and factories), the capital and labour marketplace (where jobs are obtained in exchange for wages), and the household workplace (where the work involved in bearing and raising children is performed).  Most of the examples in this book are drawn from the federal levels in Canada and the United States, the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and, to a lesser extent, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. 

   The first thesis of this book is that in both countries a coalition of business and neo-conservative anti-feminist organizations has opposed equal pay for work of equal value by seeking to restrict questions of gender-based income to non-discriminatory factors in the household and marketplace, and to prevent state intervention in the capitalist workplace and marketplace.  At the same time, a feminist-labour alliance of women's organizations and trade unions has supported state intervention in the form of equal pay for work of equal value by struggling to place responsibility for unequal pay on the shoulders of employers in the workplace, who by their discriminatory hiring and promotion practices have, in effect, taken advantage of women's double day of labour in the household and the paid labour force.  The polar-opposite participants in these struggles have been activist trade-union and new middle-class women on the one side and senior corporate executive men on the other.  Corporate women have leaned towards gender rather than class in supporting pay equity, though not without some compromise with their privileged class position.  After decades of socialization into patriarchal ideologies; trade-union men have leaned towards gender and class interests to support equal-pay legislation, though not without a painful struggle with their sister unionists.  In danger of being left out of the struggle over pay equity altogether, men in the new middle class of professionals, managers, and intelligentsia in both the public and private sectors have been pulled towards both sides.  This split has been especially evident among male economists, corporate consultants, lawyers, media writers, and state bureaucrats, although their centre of gravity, especially in the United States, appears to have shifted somewhat to an ideological defence of the male business-class position.  

   Anti-feminists and neo-conservatives have feared that the hidden agenda in the campaign for equal pay for work of equal value is the destruction of the patriarchal nuclear family.  Giving women pay equivalent to men's would make them less dependent on men, loosen their ties to the home, and provide them with greater incentive to pursue careers outside.  It has therefore been important for anti-feminist neo-conservatives to maintain the traditional separation between the public sphere of the state, the capitalist workplace, and the marketplace, and the private sphere of the household, since they see the labour and women's movements as attempting to link them in assessing the causes of, and recommending the solutions to, unequal pay.  The irony is that feminist and labour organizations have not forcefully made such links between the private and public spheres, even though they have often been made by both socialist and radical feminists. 

   In each of the three areas of struggle (paid workplace, marketplace, and household workplace), the focal points are class and gender.  A third issue, race / ethnicity, has often been pushed into the background  A dialectical relation exists between the structures and struggles of class, gender, and race / ethnicity: even though the structuring of class, gender, and race / ethnicity imposes limits on the kinds of struggles that can emerge, class, feminist, and anti-racist struggles may set the agenda as to the content of structural changes that will occur through equal-pay legislation.  For example, the structural differences in wealth between white businessmen and visible-minority working-class women has meant that the former could use high-priced lawyers and consultants in lobbying governments over pay equity while the latter could not.  Structure thus places limits on struggles.  At the same time, the struggle by trade unions and working-class women's organizations to ensure that pay equity is not achieved simply by lowering the wages of men has put so much pressure on governments that they have inserted clauses in pay-equity acts forbidding employers to lower men's wages to equalize the pay between women and men.  Thus struggles affect the content of structural changes in women's and men's wages.  As noted in Appendix A, in the 1980s the women's movement has become much more conscious of racism both in the broader society and within itself.  But business and neo-conservative elements within the new middle class have sought to exploit racial and ethnic (as well as gender) divisions in both the women's movement and the labour movement in order to divide the solidarity of the campaign for a political solution to gender-based unequal pay.  Trade unions and visible-minority women's organizations have fought back by minimizing their internal racial, gender, and class differences. 

   Using Gramsci's concept of 'passive revolution', a second thesis will be suggested in Chapter 5: that (a) racist and anti-feminist neo-conservative elements, reacting to a perceived threat to the patriarchal nuclear household from the labour-feminist alliance, have tried to fracture the solidarity of the labour and women's movements along the lines of classism, racism, and sexism; and (b) patriarchal capitalist states have tried to co-opt these movements by framing weak pay-equity legislation containing numerous loopholes and defects that make it difficult for women to win pay-equity adjustments.  The legislation of equal pay for work of equal value, although a victory for feminists and trade unionists, also represents an attempt on the part of the state to co-opt the labour and women's movements not only on behalf of business, anti-feminist, and neo-conservative interests, but at their behest. 

   CAVEATS  

   Six caveats are in order here.  First, this book deals almost exclusively with those jurisdictions where equal-pay-for-work-of-equal-value legislation is now in place.  It does not examine the lack of such legislation in Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Saskatchewan.  And it pays only cursory attention to developments in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, both of which legislated equal pay for work of equal value in the public sector in 1988, and in Quebec, which legislated proactive equal value in its human-rights law of 1975. 

   Second, although it is possible to analytically separate the components of the gendered wage gap in terms of workplace, marketplace, and household, those three areas overlap considerably: together they form a triangle, with each merely an extension of the other two. 

   Third, the intricacies of the strategies negotiated between women's groups and labour organizations, and the gender tensions between them, are not dealt with in detail in this book.  That is a separate research project requiring intensive in-depth interviewing of participants in both kinds of organizations as they develop their respective tactics in the fight for pay equity. 

   Fourth, the intricate process of collective bargaining over the setting up of job-evaluation and pay-equity plans - in other words, the implementation of legislation, once it is on the statute books - is not discussed.  This is another subject that requires a separate project, based, again, on in-depth interviewing of participants in the process. 

   The fifth caveat concerns 'class'.  Although working-class trade-union organizations have clashed with business-class associations over the shape of pay-equity legislation, there is a sense in which class has not been a consideration.  Framers of pay-equity legislation have tended to ignore the question not only of ethnic and racial differences, but also of class differences, in favour of an exclusive emphasis on gender differences in rates of pay.  There has been little discussion of the value of working-class labour compared to that of the work performed by managers and employers, the class superiors of workers.  In a retrospective critical examination of equal pay for work of equal value, George Ehring, legislative assistant in the NDP caucus of the Ontario legislature, observed: 'What we really need is a mechanism that compares the relative value of the work performed by secretaries, childcare workers and hair-dressers with that of their bosses.'  

   The sixth caveat is the most difficult to discuss.  There is considerable ambiguity in the literature as to the precise meanings of 'equal pay', 'equal work','equal value', 'equivalent value', 'comparable worth', and 'pay equity'.  'Equal work' is based on comparisons between jobs that are identical.  'similar work' depends on comparisons between jobs that are similar or substantially similar.  'Equal value' or, to use the American term, 'comparable worth', is based on comparisons between jobs that may be quite dissimilar but that can be equated in terms of a composite of effort, skill, responsibility, and working conditions (some subdimensions of these four factors are listed in Appendix B).  The ambiguity in the use of these terms reflects in part the nature of class and feminist struggles as business and anti-feminists attempt to restrict the meaning of pay equity to equal pay for identical or similar work, while labourites and feminists attempt to broaden the term to include equal pay for work of equal or comparable value. 

   The Vancouver Women's Resource Centre has raised the question of whether the state has used the term 'pay equity' - rather than the more potent 'equal pay for work of equal value' - to co-opt or defeat the feminist drive for truly equivalent wages between women and men.  One example might be the use of 'pay equity' in the 1987 Ontario Pay Equity Act, which went into effect on 1 Jan. 1988.  Why would the state, after passing a pay-equity act incorporating the equal-value principle, now point to a difference between pay equity and equal pay for work of equal value?  Why would it now raise the issue of non-gender grounds of discrimination when it always resisted extending pay equity to these areas?  Is the reason to reassure business and neo-conservatives that the provincial state has not, in fact, implemented equal pay for work of equal value?  Or is the state now agreeing with women-of-colour organizations that equal pay for work of equal value should be implemented on non-gender cultural grounds as well?  </I

   CHAPTER 4 

  Types of Groups

   Political science assumes that sound analysis has to be built on categorization.  Without having defined what we are studying we cannot observe it, measure it, or describe it - and therefore we cannot make verifiable general statements about it.  This chapter will look at the progress - or lack of progress - that political scientists have made in building a system of categories to investigate the relationship between a country's general political system and the pressure groups that work within it.  We will also suggest a taxonomy of our own. 

  CATEGORIZING GROUPS 

   Pressure group studies boast remarkably few efforts to build systems for categorization (also known as typologies or taxonomies).  Perhaps this is because it is quite easy to identify and to study formal interest groups that indisputably fit a broad definition, such as the one presented in the first chapter, once one has been agreed upon.  Pressure groups are clearly not political parties (they seek influence, not power), not government agencies (they make their own decisions and appoint their own officers), and not even interests (they are defined as being formal associations).  Scholars may quarrel over marginal cases, but the broad category, pressure groups, is generally recognized.  Consequently the literature is full of case studies - many of them excellent - of particular groups and observations of groups engaged in various phases of pressure politics.  There is even a growing number of empirical studies of groups that are clearly alike, such as business interest associations. 

   These studies tell us a lot about how groups have adapted to different political systems and have exercised influence.  They are not, however, very helpful when we try to develop general theories of political life.  They do not help us make verifiable generalizations about the political behaviour of organized groups, about their relationship to the state, or about their role in political systems, and it is very hard to set out a grand theory that does not include such generalizations.  Of course, political scientists, myself included, have succumbed to the temptation to propose grand theories, but we all know that these theories are little more than informed speculation, flawed because the studies on which they are based are not comparable.  While such studies generally share a common definition of the term 'interest / pressure group' - although even here, as we have seen, differences persist - there is only rudimentary agreement about the kinds of interest groups that are to he found.  This prevents us from understanding why very different kinds of pressure groups emerge, why their behaviour varies, and why some groups appear to be more influential than others. 

   Before exploring these issues more fully, it is useful to review the principles that guide categorization.  We can apply those principles to some of the rudimentary typologies that have been used in studying pressure groups, and use them to build a system of categories of our own.  The principles we shall draw upon, which have been widely used in the social sciences, can he expressed as five rules: 

   Rule l: Pertinence.  

   The categories must be set up to address an explicitly defined research problem.  For example, John E. Chubb, in Interest Groups and the Bureaucracy, divides the groups in his study of California energy politics into two categories: cost-bearers and beneficiaries.  This approach is pertinent to a case study that tries to explain group behaviour in a single policy dispute, but it would not help us classify interest groups in general because groups are seldom consistently cost-bearers or beneficiaries.  In other words, the categories may vary a good deal according to our research interests, but it is important to ensure that they are appropriate to the research question being addressed. 

   Rule 2: Exhaustiveness.  

   The categories should take into account every type of group that exists in the system under study.  If we want to study the pressure group system in a country, we cannot be content with a typology that captures only business, women's, or religious groups. 

   Rule 3: Exclusiveness.  

   The categories should be mutually exclusive and independent.  This is a most difficult requirement, but it is essential since it forces us to discriminate between groups and allows us to explore their differences.  The distinction between 'public interest groups' and'special interest groups' is popular because a public interest can be distinguished from a private, or special, interest.  On the other hand, even though a distinction between 'lobby' groups and 'protest' groups is equally popular because it evokes colourful images of the different behaviour of the 'ins' and the 'outs', the distinction is not helpful analytically.  This is because so-called 'protest' groups often lobby and occasionally even powerful lobby groups protest.  The activities of protesting and lobbying, in other words, do not consistently differentiate groups. 

   Rule 4: One category / one principle.  

   We cannot build individual categories by combining characteristics that have been established on the basis of different principles.  For example, when we refer to organizations as 'business', 'environmental', or 'civil rights' groups we are implicitly using a single principle to differentiate them.  In this case, we are sorting them out according to their central objectives, which we have concluded are to promote business, or environmental concerns, or the protection of civil rights.  Suppose that we tried to combine this principle with another one: the level of organizational complexity attained by each group.  How would we do it?  Would we say that all business groups are highly organized and all environmental groups not?  If we were to do so, how would we categorize Greenpeace, which, with its extensive international network, is a highly complex environmental group - probably more complex than most business interest associations.  Clearly, by combining two different methods of distinguishing groups we make the task of sorting them out much more difficult, if not impossible.  We would be better off if we analysed one category in terms of another; we could look at protest groups, for example, to determine how many are highly organized, weakly organized, and so on. 

   Rule 5: Respect the level of analysis.  

   Each set of categories enables us to carry out analysis at a specific level.  A set of categories designed to study the pressure groups operating in a particular policy field will not help us examine the efforts made by political parties, lobbying firms, corporations, officials, and individuals to influence those policies.  To do that, we would have to move to the next level of analysis, the policy system, and to employ a new set of analytical tools.  

   How well do our categories for pressure groups adhere to these rules?  When we set out to distinguish pressure groups from other political actors we seem to be on firm ground.  The distinctions drawn between pressure groups, parties, government agencies, and so on in Chapter 1 have been generally accepted for a number of years and have helped keep us from violating the level of analysis precepts of Rule 5.  Similarly, we have learned to distinguish between the three types of interests - latent, solidary, and organized or formal - and to maintain a clear distinction in analysis between organized groups and the other two types.  

   When we attempt to distinguish between organized pressure groups we run into trouble, largely because we tend to ignore our first rule of categorization.  We do not keep in mind the research questions that different methods of categorization are designed to address.  Consequently we often fall into the trap of using a category designed to explore one question to address others.  Equally, there is a danger of criticizing a typology developed for one purpose simply because it does not address another.  To ensure that the following critique avoids this trap, we will briefly consider the research question that a general typology should address. 

   The questions at the heart of political science have to do with power, specifically, the power of the state - what it consists of, how it is used, who gets to use it, when and where.  Pressure groups, by definition, do not seek to use state power directly, but rather to influence it.  Consequently, the broadest and central questions that political scientists ask when they study pressure groups have to do with how groups exert influence and how their efforts are received by the state.  In short, they are most concerned with the relationship between the state and pressure groups.  There are, of course, many other questions political scientists ask about pressure groups - questions about how groups determine which issues they will pursue and about the effect membership characteristics and opinions have on group behaviour, for example - but the core questions have to do with state / group relations and all others are subsidiary.  Any method of classification intended for general use in political analysis should be designed to address this central concern.  Guided by this conclusion, the critique that follows is intended to assess the capacity of widely used typologies to assist our explorations of the core questions of political science.  It should be remembered that typologies shown to be inadequate for this level of analysis may be extremely useful in addressing other questions. 

   Two methods of categorization are popular with academics, journalists, and interest group members themselves.  The first divides organized groups according to their objectives - protest, environmental, civil rights, and public interest groups, to name a few.  Collectively those groups that pursue public-regarding objectives are often referred to as 'public interest' groups, while those that attend to the exclusive and generally material benefits of their members are often labelled'special interest' groups.  The second classifies by the character of the members - business, ethnic, or women's groups for example. 

   Research that applies this two-fold division of groups shows that it fails to conform to two of our five rules of categorization, and therefore fails as a typology.  It does not meet the requirement for exclusiveness or the requirement that a category should be based on a single principle.  Some scholars assure us that despite the considerable overlap between groups that fall into the material benefit category and those designated as attitude groups, 'one is able to assign a group to one or the other category quite easily'.  This is not in fact the case.  It is extremely difficult to show that there are characteristics unique to groups in each category. 

   A good illustration is found in Jeffrey Berry's survey of 83 public interest groups based in Washington in the early 1970s and his case studies of two of them.  These studies show that when groups focus exclusively on public interest objectives, they tend to experience problems of organization, access, and resource mobilization, and that these circumstances generally lead them to use some pressure strategies - such as publicity, confrontation, and litigation - rather than others, like consultation and co-operation.  However, if we compare Berry's findings with research into material benefit groups, we discover similar characteristics.  Business interest associations are more likely to use consultation and co-operation rather than publicity and confrontation, but they may still use the latter techniques.  Organizational characteristics are more likely to be distinct.  Business interest groups tend to be better developed organizationally and to have more extensive membership participation in policy-making than public interest groups, while public interest groups are more likely to have been created by individuals whose charisma and entrepreneurial skills keep them alive and draw media attention to their causes.  Even on this dimension, however, it is possible to find public interest groups that are more fully developed than many business groups and others that encourage membership participation.  We have to conclude, then, that we cannot create water-tight divisions between groups by associating material benefit objectives with one category of group and altruistic objectives with the others.  
 </I

   The Role and Nature of Conventions 

   The Canadian political system is shaped by a wide variety of constitutional rules that go well beyond the provisions of our formal Constitution.  While section 52 of the 1982 Constitution Act declares that some two dozen British and Canadian statutes and orders-in-council comprise our Constitution, and are the'supreme law of Canada', Canadian constitutional law also includes many other legal rules found in statutes, orders-in-council, and judicial decisions relating to the executive, the judiciary, and the legislature.  But even when they are added to the Constitution, we have only an incomplete and distorted view of our political system.  The whole constitution is actually composed of three elements: the formal Constitution; the legal rules relating to the three branches of government; and, in addition, vitally important informal rules, called conventions, that have arisen through political practice.  As many areas of the constitution are structured by archaic or incomplete laws, the political arena has given birth to binding conventions and customary usages that not only direct political actors in these matters, but ultimately determine the full substance and character of the Canadian constitution.  Even the 'supreme law' of the Constitution is often remoulded by the force of conventions, which both complete the constitution and allow it to evolve with changes in prevailing values. 

   Every major aspect of the constitution depends on conventions.  The sweeping legal powers of the Governor General are transferred by convention to the Cabinet.  The very basis of responsible government - with the requirements that both individual ministers and the Cabinet collectively must account to the legislature for the activities of the executive branch of government - is a vital matter that has been entirely left out of the formal Constitution.  Both the operation of disciplined parties, which give the basic character to our legislatures, and the relationship between the House of Commons and the Senate, are similarly determined by convention.  Many of the rules giving effect to the federal principle have arisen from political practice rather than from the formal division of powers, found in the original Constitution Act of 1867 and in subsequent judicial pronouncements.  The basic independence of the judiciary has grown to a large extent out of informal rules as well as legal guarantees. 

   With the role conventions play in transforming the formal Constitution, it is crucial to have a full appreciation of the manner in which the legal and conventional rules of the constitution interact.  Perhaps the greatest weakness of traditional examinations of the Canadian constitution is the over-simplification of both the character of constitutional conventions and their relationship with the positive laws of the constitution. 

   Two distinct and somewhat contradictory trends relating to constitutional conventions appear to be at play in Canada.  One tendency is to draw a clear boundary between law and convention.  In its opinions on the 1981 reference questions about the amendment of the Constitution, the Supreme Court of Canada drew a sharp distinction between conventions, as political rules, and the legal rules enforced by the courts.  The majority summarized their views with the formula: 'Constitutional conventions plus constitutional law equal the total constitution of the country.'  Although this statement illustrates the importance of conventions, it drastically oversimplifies the variety of rules that make up the constitution, as well as how they interrelate. 

   The second major trend lies in an increasing propensity to seek the legal regulation or judicial resolution of issues normally governed by convention.  The justiciability of conventions may become an increasingly important issue in Canadian constitutional theory.  Peter Russell has noted that Canadian political culture has become more litigious in recent decades, with legal solutions sought for political disputes.  The inclination to seek a legal resolution of matters involving conventions was further exemplified after the 1985 general election in Ontario.  When the Liberals and the New Democratic Party announced they had reached an agreement ensuring that the NDP would support a Liberal government for two years, Premier Frank Miller immediately sought legal advice about whether this agreement could be challenged in the courts - even though it clearly related only to matters governed by convention.  For his part, Lieutenant Governor John B. Aird consulted with a noted constitutional lawyer, J.J. Robinette, about the avenues of action open to him.  Thus a trend seems to be developing where legal solutions are sought for problems involving conventions. 

   The outcome of these two trends should be of great interest to students of the Canadian constitution.  If conventional rules come to inhabit some legal dimension, there may be significant consequences for the constitutional process.  Any increased propensity to seek judicial remedies for matters involving conventions could further enhance the power of the judiciary to regulate the activities of elected officials.  Some concern might be expressed at this prospect, since conventions have always represented a valued method by which a constitution may evolve informally through the actions of politicians who both respond and are accountable to the electorate.  If conventions become increasingly justiciable, there is some danger that the democratic quality of constitutional evolution might be eroded.  On the other hand, too clear a boundary between court-enforceable constitutional laws and conventional rules might see the courts enforcing outdated rules that not only lack any political legitimacy but may also be destructive. 

  THE NATURE OF CONVENTIONS 

   In the interests of clarity, a working definition of conventions is needed before proceeding further.  What exactly is meant by a constitutional convention may be most easily explained by citing the formulation of Geoffrey Marshall and Graeme Moodie: 

  By conventions of the constitution, we mean binding rules of constitutional behaviour which are considered to be binding by and upon those who operate the Constitution, but which are not enforced by the law courts (although the courts may recognise their existence), nor by the presiding officers in the Houses of Parliament.  

   Curiously few Canadian writers have ventured their own definitions of conventions.  Eugene Forsey calls them 'the acknowledged, binding, extra-legal customs, usages, practices and understandings by which our system of government operates.'  Both of these definitions, however, fail to distinguish conventions from the 'laws and customs of Parliament', a distinction insisted upon by most British authors. 

   Despite the importance of conventions to the Canadian constitution, surprisingly little has been written on the subject by Canadian scholars.  Canadian constitutional lawyers seldom seem to give much attention to the topic, perhaps heeding A.V. Dicey's injunction of over a century ago that the subject of conventions 'is not one of law but of politics, and need trouble no lawyer or the class of any professor of law.'  In general, however, much of the discussion in the Canadian literature has focused over the years on the terms of particular conventions.  Very little attention has been paid by Canadian scholars to the nature of conventions and how they may relate to other constitutional rules. 

   The most rigorous discussions of constitutional theory and the nature of conventions may be found in a number of works by British scholars.  Dicey  

   The distinction between law and convention is often implicitly treated by constitutional writers as dating from A.V. Dicey's An Introduction to the Law of the Constitution, first published in 1885.  Certainly Dicey's examination of conventional rules was more thorough than any previous work and has come to be one of the leading texts in British constitutional theory.  However, scholarly attention to the difference between the legal rules and the political practices and principles of the constitution predates Dicey's work considerably.  Hood Phillips has detailed the evolution of British constitutional theory and the growing distinction made between law and political practice.  The existence of these two types of rules was noted by Edmund Burke in the eighteenth century and was progressively expanded upon by later authors.  But Dicey laid much of the foundation of modern constitutional theory when he drew a fundamental distinction between 

 'the law of the constitution', which, consisting (as it does) of rules enforced or recognised by the courts, makes up a body of 'law' in the proper sense of that term, and the 'conventions of the constitution', which, consisting (as they do) of customs, practices, maxims, or precepts which are not enforced or recognised by the courts, make up a body not of laws, but of constitutional or political ethics ...   

  Dicey's clear separation of law and convention, on the grounds of court-enforceability, has been a pervasive element in theories of constitutional law ever since. 

   There is a clear consensus among scholars since Dicey's time about the general purposes that conventions serve.  Their main function is to allow the exercise of legal powers in some manner other than that prescribed by the letter of the law.  As Jennings put it, '... they provide the flesh which clothes the dry bones of the law.'  Some conventions stipulate that the powers of a certain office be exercised only in certain circumstances; for example, the Governor General's power of dissolution is limited to a few situations.  Other conventions ensure that one actor's legal power is effectively exercised in practice by someone else; thus much of the prerogative power of the Crown is determined exclusively by Cabinet rather than by the monarch.  Finally, a few conventions negate some existing legal power or duty; for instance, a convention now releases the Governor General from the duty imposed in s.56 of the 1867 Constitution Act to send copies to the Queen of all federal legislation enacted into law.  The primary benefit of these functions of conventions is that they permit the adaptation of constitutional rules to changes in the general political principles and values of the day, without the need for formal amendment of existing positive law. 

   There is, however, some uncertainty over how conventions come to be established and how they may be identified.  Moreover, there is a fundamental division of opinion concerning the legal character of conventions.  The near dichotomy that Dicey drew is both hotly defended and criticized. 

  LAW AND CONVENTION 

   Dicey set the battle-lines for a continuing debate on the nature of conventions in 1885, when he declared that conventions 'are not in reality laws at all since they are not enforced by the Courts.'  Laws are enforced in the courts, while conventions are said to be enforced in the political arena alone; this is the essence of the distinction made between law and convention. 

   Some authors, however, have taken issue with the neatness of this dividing line.  Jennings has been the most influential constitutional theorist to argue that conventions are not so easily separated from legal rules as the judicial-enforcement test implies.  He has claimed that, in their substance, laws and conventions are often inextricably interrelated;  Although both authors willingly point out certain differences between law and convention, neither would accept Dicey's assertion that these rules are 'of a totally different character.' 

   The main bone of contention between these two schools of thought is the role conventions may play in judicial proceedings.  The debate focuses not only on the more empirical question of how judges have treated conventions, but also on the normative issue of how the courts should treat them.  </I

    The Capitalist Workplace 

   The struggle over pay equity has affected most centrally the capitalist workplace: the offices, factories, and mines where women and men are employed to earn a measure of subsistence so that others may profit by their labour.  Changes in the capitalist labour process (the way tools and equipment are combined with labour to produce commodities) have interacted with the way wages are divided up between women and men.  This interaction occurs in three ways.  First, under the strongest pro-active versions of  'equal pay for work of equal value' , employers and union bargaining agents are mandated to negotiate pay-equity plans in the capitalist workplace itself.  These plans attempt to define more precisely the value of work and how it is divided up between women and men.  Second, unions interpret pay-equity legislation as holding out the possibility of increasing their control over the labour process, while employers regard such legislation as a threat to their control.  Where unions have not existed in particular workplaces (and this has been typical for women), pay-equity plans reaffirm managerial control over workers by giving employers the right to unilaterally impose their own desired form of pay equity, subject to the approval of state pay-equity commis  sions or bureaus.  Third, both unions and employers have con  tended that pay equity would have long-reaching implications for the structure of work.  The labour-feminist alliance has argued that pay equity would increase the productivity of women by making them more satisfied with their level of monetary compensation; managers and employers have argued that equal pay for work of equal value would lead to a restructuring of the labour process in the direction of more part-time work, more subcontracting of work, and faster replacement of intensive labour with labour-saving technology.  It will be argued in this chapter that the labour-feminist affiance has invited state intervention in the capitalist workplace primarily to redress women's lower wages, but in a form that would increase the control by women workers and unions over the labour process, while business has opposed state intervention in the paid workplace for this very reason. 

   MODELS: COMPLAINT, PRO-ACTIVE, INTEGRATED 

   There are three main pay-equity models: complaint, employer-in  itiated or pro-active, and integrated.  In the  complaint  model, com  mon in human-rights legislation, women employees are entitled to file complaints alleging that their jobs are not being paid on a basis equal to similar or comparable male jobs.  This method exists in the 1978 Canadian Human Rights Act, the Employment Stand  ards Acts of Manitoba and Ontario, and the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms enacted in 1975.  The  employer-initiated  or  pro-active  model requires the implementation of job-evaluation and pay-equity plans by the employer in non-unionized establishments and jointly by employees and employers through collective bargaining in unionized workplaces.  This model is prominent in the legislation of Min  nesota in the US, the Manitoba Pay Equity Act of 1985 (where disputes are referred to arbitration or the labour board), and the 1988 Nova Scotia Pay Equity Act (which has no dispute-settlement mechanism).  The  integrated  model provides for combinations of the complaint and pro-active models.  This was the approach adopted in the 1986 Ontario Public Service Pay Equity Bill, the 1987 Ontario Pay Equity Act, and the 1988 Prince Edward Island Pay Equity Act: the pro-active model is effective in an initial phase, when employers and employees are to negotiate a pay-equity plan; later, complaints could be lodged for failure to comply with the plan.  Complaints may be made only about contraventions of the acts and are limited to how the acts define pay equity, its implementation, restrictions, and exemptions.  A fully-integrated act would not impose such restrictions on the complaints that could be lodged.   1    Generally, business and the neo-conservatives, if they had to accept any type of equal-pay legislation, favoured the complaint model,   2   or one based on  'voluntary compliance' , in which it was left up to employers to decide how best to equalize wages.   3    Managers and personnel officers in the new middle class fell in line with this position.   4    The feminist-labour alliance, on the other hand, favoured the pro-active model either by itself or in combination with the complaint procedure in the integration model.  The Equal Pay Coalition of Ontario came up with a rela  tively innovative plan: the pro-active setting-up of pay-equity plans was to apply only to unionized workplaces and workplaces with 100 employees or more; workplaces with fewer than 100 employees and unorganized workplaces would only have to fol  low the complaint model.   5   

   COVERAGE 

   In several national, Canadian provincial, and US state jurisdic  tions there are three issues variously at stake regarding the coverage of women by pay-equity legislation:  gender predominance , (should job comparisons be made between female-dominated and male-dominated jobs, or between all jobs, regardless of their gender composition?);  establishment  (should job comparisons be made only within a single establishment of the same employer, or between establishments of the same and / or different employers?); and  sector  (should the legislation apply only to the public sector, or a subpart of that sector, or to the private sector as well?).  Business has wanted to exclude as many women as pos  sible from coverage, while feminist and trade-union organizations have wanted the broadest possible coverage.  Each issue will be discussed in turn. 

     1. Gender predominance   

   In pro-active and integrated pay-equity legislation, gender predominance is usually specified, so that the law covers only  'women's positions' , or those occupied mainly by women.  The 1985 Manitoba Pay Equity Act applies only to those jobs in the public sector in which 70 per cent or more are women; com  parisons can be made only with those jobs in which 70 per cent or more of the occupants are men.  These levels can be changed through negotiations between employers and employees.   6    The 1988 Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island Pay Equity Acts define both female and male predominance at the 60 per cent level.   7    In the Ontario  Green Paper on Pay Equity  it was suggested that pay-equity adjustments could be carried out only by compar  ing female-predominant with male-predominant jobs, but the question of determining gender predominance was left open.  A number of methods from other jurisdictions were discussed: a sliding scale of 55 to 70 per cent, based on the number of employees per establishment, proposed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission; a statistical formula proposed by a com  parable-worth commission in New York State; consideration of historical patterns, especially in those occupations that were once female-predominant and consequently still receive low pay; or the arbitrary 70 per cent cut-off figure plus the possibility of negotiat  ing other levels, as in the Manitoba legislation.   8     The Ontario Public Service Pay Equity bill and the 1987 Ontario Pay Equity Act provide for a 70 per cent cut-off for predominantly male jobs and a 60 per cent cut-off for predominantly female jobs unless these levels are changed through negotiation between employers and employees.   9    In many complaint-based human-rights and employ  ment-standards acts, gender predominance is not formally defined or acknowledged.   10    However, in 1978 a Canadian Human Rights Commission (  CHRC ) Task Force recognized the issue of gender predominance in the case of group complaints.   11    In November 1986, the  CHRC  accepted a sliding scale based on the number of employees in an occupational group to determine gender predominance.   12    The cut-offs were as follows: fewer than 100 employees, 70 per cent; 100 to 500, 60 per cent; and more than 500, 55 per cent.   13    In smaller occupational groups, because the cut-off is higher, there is a greater chance that women will not qualify for equal-pay adjustments.  Regardless of group size, the Canadian Human Rights Act applies to all persons in each occupa  tion.  It does not have the minimum-of-ten threshold found in the 1985 Manitoba and 1988 Nova Scotia Acts. 

    (a) The business position  

   Business interests have either rejected any definition of gender predominance or wanted the cut-off to be set as high as possible and made inflexible, so that very few women qualify for pay-equi  ty adjustments.  In Canada in 1986 the Automotive Parts Manufac  turers Association opposed defining gender predominance in any way.   14    The Ontario Chamber of Commerce thought that the 60 per cent to 70 per cent contemplated by the government was too low, and wanted the levels for both male- and female-predominant jobs established at between 80 and 90 per cent.   15    Other business as  sociations wanted a level higher than the 60 to 70 per cent range without specifying exact percentages.   16    Such employer groups as the Ontario Mining Association, Ontario Hydro, the Municipal Electric Association, and the Canadian  Manufacturers'  Associa  tion took the less extreme position of favouring the 70 per cent cut-off level.   17    The Board of Trade of Metropolitan Toronto wanted to have a phase-in period for gender predominance: during the first year of pay equity, the threshold for male- and female-predominant jobs would be set at 90 per cent, to fall 5 per cent in each subsequent year until it reached a 70 per cent plateau.  To avoid the uncertain effects of fluctuations in the thresholds, it recommended a three-year stabilization period before a level could be established, and wanted a ban on any negotiations between unions and management to reduce the figure below 70 per cent.   18    The Day Care Advisory Committee of Metropolitan Toronto, which on other issues leaned more towards the business position than the feminist one, favoured a 50 per cent threshold for female predominance on the grounds that women's participa  tion rate in the labour force would soon reach this level.   19    The  Manufacturers'  Association also wanted the 70 per cent figure, which it favoured, to be non-negotiable and applicable to groups of no less than 10 employees, with  'group'  defined as  'occupation  al type rather than evaluated grade level' , and a three-year stabilization period.   20   

   (b) The labour-feminist position  

   In the Ontario and Manitoba debates, the feminist-labour alliance mounted seven responses to the neo-conservative business ap  proach to gender predominance. 

    NO CUT-OFF .  As one option, many in the feminist-labour alliance rejected completely any automatic numerical cut-off figure, whether applied to female- or male-predominant jobs.   21    The On  tario Equal Pay Coalition stated its objection graphically:   'A fixed percentage could work like a guillotine and automatically exclude large numbers of women who deserve the right to file a com  plaint.'    22     The National Action Committee on the Status of Women warned that automatic cut-off figures for gender predominance would give employers grounds to launch court appeals under the Canadian Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, resulting in years of delays in implementing pay equity.   23    The Public Service Alliance of Canada argued that  'any threshold level that restricts the initiation of a complaint is a direct violation of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms' .   24   

    LOWER CUT-OFF .  As another option, several feminist and labour organizations suggested lower numerical figures than 70 per cent in the determination of gender predominance.  The Charter of Rights Coalition in Manitoba and the Manitoba Association of Woman and the Law suggested a 60 per cent figure for both female- and male-dominated jobs.   25    Organized Working Women, and Ontario Equal Pay Coalition, the Ontario Coalition for Better Daycare, and the Federal of Women  Teachers'  Association of Ontario suggested that, since women make up 44 per cent of the labour force, gender the predominance should be set at a level just above this figure.   26   

    FLEXIBILITY .  Trade unions and feminist groups wanted as much flexibility as possible in the determination of gender predominance.   27    In particular, they said, sex stereotypes and the historical patterns of gender predominance should be taken into account.   28    For example, some low-paying occupations that are now dominated by men were once dominated by women, and this historical pattern has influenced current wages.   29    Women in such occupations should be able to qualify for the pay-equity adjustments despite the fact that they are not in female-predominant jobs.   30    The Ontario Equal Pay Coalition suggested a dual approach to gender predominance: in the pro-active setting-up of pay-equity plans, use a flexible approach that takes into account historical patterns and sex stereotyping of some occupations; in the complaint pro  cedure, abandon the notion of gender predominance completely.   31   

    COLLECTIVE BARGAINING .  Trade unions more than feminist or  ganizations pushed for the determination of gender predominance through collective bargaining rather than unilaterally, by management fiat.   32    Although many feminist or  ganizations accepted collective bargaining as a means to achieve pay equity, some were suspicious of male domination in negotia  tions, resulting in the dropping of  'women's issues'  (such as child care or affirmative action) from packages presented to employers in favour of general wage and benefits increases desired by male majorities in many unions. 
    VICTORIA: Now a world-beater  
  Text by Laura Langston

   Something drastic has happened to Victoria, Old Chap.  It's simply not the same city it was just a few years ago.  Not so much the "bit of England," not even, anymore, the retirement capital of Canada.  The adjectives travel writers love to apply to Victoria - quaint, idyllic, old-world - don't quite do anymore.  Victoria has become more complex than that.  Mix in more adjectives like stylish, exhilarating, imaginative.  Then you will have more of an idea of a city breaking out of its mold while trying not to leave behind what always made it so appealing.  Then say it has the most pleasant environment in the world, as a major U.S.-based travel publication just proclaimed. 

   Victoria, British Columbia's capital city, is humming.  Millions of dollars are pouring in for beautification, restoration, and development.  Thousands of people are coming to stay, not necessarily to retire. 

   It was only a matter of time that this loveliest of cities, massaged by a gentle climate on the southern tip of a huge Pacific island, would start to burgeon. 

   In losing its predictable image, some residents worry that Victoria's soul is vanishing with it.  Others say the winds of change are reviving its spirit. 

   "The task before us now is to marry growth and preservation and do it creatively, in a way that adds to the quality of our city", says building designer Chris Gower.  "We must have pride in who we are, but we must have vision, too." 

   More than ever, the holidayers are coming: 2.5 million of them last year.  On the streets above the harbor, summer tourists, cameras dangling, brochures in hand, crowd onto double-decker buses and horse-drawn caravans for tours of the city.  Breaking out of its cliche-ridden mold, a quickly growing city begins to hum with energy.  Pedal-powered kabuki cabs weave through the traffic, people pose beside a kilted bagpiper playing on a corner.  The harbor's abuzz with floatplanes, jet-propelled catamarans, yachts, tour boats, and a stray kayaker dipping about.  People constantly drift back between harborside, the Empress Hotel, the B.C. Legislative Buildings, and the Royal Provincial Museum.  Or they head up Government Street for the shops, restaurants, and sidewalk cafes. 

   Victoria always has been a town for lingering, for strolling.  But recent development has stepped up the tempo and brought a "big city" feel. 

   It is no longer the retirement capital of Canada, a place on the southern tip of Vancouver Island where prairie farmers come to visit their parents.  Victoria, which for years had the country's highest population of senior citizens, now has fallen behind Halifax and other Canadian communities as a retirement centre. 

   While the bustle of downtown is most noticeable with the annual torrent of tourists, the new growth throughout Greater Victoria is prevalent year-round.  Farms on the once pastoral Saanich Peninsula are rapidly becoming new residential and commercial subdivisions.  The rural western communities of Colwood, View Royal, and Metchosin now are incorporated municipalities. 

   As we enter the 1990s, Victoria's population is nearly 270,000, an increase of more than 110,000 since the early '60s.  Major expansions of the Trans-Canada and Patricia Bay Highways - the city's main commuter routes - seek to relieve bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic, something Victorians once believed was only a mainland misfortune.  At worst.  Victoria used to have "rush minutes."  Now, during the height of the tourist season, more than 94,000 vehicles a day enter Victoria on these two highways. 

   Yet, despite its quickening pace.  Victoria continues to cultivate and expand its agreeable downtown ambience.  The result: international acclaim.  In its November issue, Conde Nast Traveler, in its second annual readers poll, announced that Victoria ranked first worldwide in the category of pleasant environment.  Overall it was judged the eighth best city - ahead of any other Canadian city and up there with the likes of Florence, Paris, and San Francisco.  Having the blessing of Conde Nast, a magazine based in New York and aimed at affluent travellers, one can expect more tourists coming from more distant places. 

   Meanwhile, the newest Victorians have come mainly from Alberta, Ontario and other parts of B.C.  Like the tourists, they're attracted by the mild, marine climate - Canada's kindest - the surrounding mountain and ocean views, and the easy access to Vancouver Island's rugged outdoors. 

   To outsiders, Victoria is well-known for its predictable, old-world charm.  Canada's city of gardens, high teas, and heritage.  It is promoted - relentlessly and successfully - as a "bit of England," which is, paradoxically, true and false. 

   A few of the heritage buildings are gone, replaced by new development, and some new ones are built to look old.  Yet, to retain that Victorian flavor, considerable money is being poured into the restoration of significant buildings. 

   Two hundred of B.C.'s heritage buildings are in the downtown core and many embellish residential areas.  These old buildings are reminiscent of the city's beginnings in 1843 as a Hudson's Bay Fort and as a gold-rush stopover in the 1850s and '90s.  It was then that much of Victoria's modern-day appearance began to take shape.  The city centre now is charmingly irregular with cobblestone squares and Europeanlike alleys, an easy, pleasant downtown to wander.  At the heart of the city is its harbor, where major development on its downtown side has been kept to a minimum. 

   Though development is most noticeable in the downtown core, it is happening all over the region.  In 1988, 8,642 building permits worth nearly $400 million were issued. 

   There is, the skeptics say, no real reason for the building boom, except to serve a flourishing tourist trade.  Others disagree and say the development is healthy and will prevent Victoria from remaining a sleepy backwater town. 

   Today, some buildings that speak eloquently of Victoria's past are being brought back to life.  The city's largest hotel, the Empress, has recently undergone a $45-million facelift.  The 82-year-old landmark has been restored to reflect its original opulence, yet it is also modernized.   An addition, styled after the original building, has been built to provide more rooms, a new registration area, a pool and recreation rooms.  Older rooms have new wiring, new plumbing and new decor that reflects the dignity of past eras. 

   Considerable sums were spent renovating the Crystal Ballroom, Bengal Lounge, and Palm Court.  In the Palm Court alone, $50,000 was invested into refurbishing a striking domed ceiling with ornate plaster shields and stained glass that had been covered and lost in the 1960s. 

   A few blocks from the Empress is the new Eaton Centre, a development that has divided many Victorians.  When it was proposed in 1986 by Cadillac Fairview, a Toronto firm, there had been no increase in downtown retail space for 10 years.  Instead of welcoming the company, normally quiet, uninvolved Victorians joined to fight the "boys from Toronto."  The ensuing protest was long and bitter. 

   Proponents said the massive new shopping complex would revitalize the downtown core.  Opponents said it would gut a block of the old town, wiping out 11 heritage buildings.  These included the Driard Hotel (c.1892), which was the premier hotel until the Empress took over in 1908.  It would also jeopardize those independent downtown merchants who had held the core together for so long.  Diverse groups of heritage lovers, merchants, and concerned citizens formed the Save Our City Coalition which collected more than 7,000 names on petitions. 

   Despite the opposition, Cadillac Fairview was permitted to build its $100-million, 150-store centre, and efforts taken to preserve the "old English" look of Victoria.  Through the sale of Broad Street, a downtown lane partially lost in the development, the city made $1.9 million to put into a downtown investment fund for preserving and upgrading the heritage buildings that were left. 

   The new Eaton Centre is built to look old, a four-storey, brick-faced structure with the salvaged facades of some demolished heritage buildings.  It even has imitation windows with venetian blinds painted on for effect. 

   Many heritage lovers were appalled.  It was, they cried, a compromise that had nothing to do with heritage. 

   "It's a sad, obscene mockery of what was there," in the opinion of Mark Madoff, Hallmark Society president and founding member of the Save Our City Coalition.  "We would have preferred a good, modern design over what we got.  We're sacrificing quality by putting up these pseudo-heritage type buildings.  They don't satisfy anyone." 

   It seems, however, shoppers, browsers, and sightseers don't agree: they're flocking around Eaton Centre, and there's no doubt that this structure has added presence to the city's heart. 

   With the first phase of the Eaton Centre open, the second phase is due for completion in August.  City planner Len Vopnfjord says it's the beginning of a trend for downtown, and many, he adds, share his satisfaction with the development. 

   Though people may be split on the Eaton Centre, the new Victoria Conference Centre has been well-received.  Erected behind the Empress Hotel at a cost of $22 million, the 1,500-seat complex takes advantage of the landmarks all around it: the Empress, the B.C. Legislative Buildings, the Crystal Gardens, Thunderbird Park. 

   "The conference centre either shows these things up as a backdrop or it incorporates elements of their design into its own design," says Robert Amos, a local artist well-known for his watercolor street scapes.  "So there is harmony and resonance from one building to another." 

   With its large, outdoor plaza, towering atrium, cupolas and domes, the conference is an example of a well-executed new design.  It has restored the confidence of many discriminating Victorians.  "Whoever heard of a major new building being erected lower than the surrounding buildings," exclaims Amos.  "It's a brilliant idea." 

   "It has given us a different vision of what we can look like," says Marilyn Callahan, director of the School of Social Work at the University of Victoria.  "In the past we've looked at new developments and found them wanting.  Now we see they can be high-quality and tasteful and fit into the downtown ambience." 

   That ambience, particularly on the waterfront, is changing quickly.  Across the harbor from the Empress, the Songhees Indian land, once an industrial eyesore, is turning into upscale condominiums and green space.  When finished, there will be 1,500 housing units, a major marina, floating restaurant, and 250-room hotel: total price - $75 million.  The development includes a waterfront walkway from the Songhees land to neighboring West Bay. 

   Development on the Songhees land and in West Bay is adding a new dimension to an area considered "on the wrong side of the (Johnson Street) bridge" for years.  However, a five-kilometre seaside promenade will soon join the two sides of the harbor. 

   Speculators now are looking to other parts of the harbor.  Two sites on Wharf Street, between the Songhees land and the Empress, are being eyed as areas for an open public market, a new maritime museum, and transportation facilities for passengers arriving by plane or boat. 

   Though development is being emphasized, heritage buildings are not being ignored, particularly on Government Street, which the Eaton Centre fronts.  One of the oldest streets in the city, Government was the centre of Victoria 100 years ago.  It has become a tourist mecca in recent years, with some shops staying open until 11 p.m. during summer.  Now, international retailers like Ralph Lauren clothiers are moving onto Government, giving the street an upscale feel. 

   Across from the Eaton Centre on Government, Munro's Books is in a 1909 Royal Bank of Canada building.  In 1984, after sitting idle for three years, the interior had become shabby.  Owner Jim Munro refurbished it in just eight weeks.  Today, original Corinthian-topped columns tower up the high ornate ceiling.  Stained glass and beautiful artwork shows above dark wooden bookshelves.  Munro is pleased to have the Eaton Centre as his new neighbor. 

   Lower Johnson, another key street in those early days, is also coming back to life.  During the Cariboo and Klondike gold rushes, Johnson was Victoria's front door since boats berthed at its foot.  Virtually everyone who arrived travelled up Johnson.  Over the years, Johnson Street declined into a skid row.  A few developments, however, are changing that. 

   In the mid-1970s, the Market Square project on Johnson was unveiled.  Rundown buildings and an old ravine were turned into three levels of shops, restaurants, and offices opening onto a plant-filled courtyard.  Today, Market Square is popular with residents and tourists alike, but for some years it sat like a fresh new island in the middle of decrepitude. 

   About four years ago, when developer Michael Williams turned his attention to lower Johnson, the area began picking up.  </I
    Triangle Island   
  Photography and text by Larry Pynn 
   A million seabirds count on it  

   Anchored amid the swirling mists and breakers off northwestern Vancouver Island is a place so small and seemingly inconsequential it remains virtually unknown.  But to more than one million seabirds, Triangle Island is British Columbia's greatest nesting colony.  In a province with 27,300 kilometres of rugged and largely unpopulated coastline, this remote island is the nesting place of one-fifth of B.C.'s breeding seabirds.  Its numbers nearly equal those of the Queen Charlotte Islands combined. 

   Located 45 kilometres northwest of Cape Scott, at the outermost of the Scott Islands group, 85-hectare Triangle Island is on the marine highway to nowhere.  The island served as a lighthouse station from 1910 to 1919.  However, that function was all but useless, even though the lighthouse was, at 210 metres, the highest one on the coast.  In 1912 a hurricane blew the well-secured tower over a cliff.  Soon rebuilt, it was doomed to close because heavy fogs frequently obscured its light.  Today only mice, voles, and rabbits permanently inhabit this forbidding island.  Human visitors, thankfully, are as infrequent as sunshine.  They are occasional fishermen seeking safe haven in Pacific storms, and researchers pondering the propagation of seabirds. 

   Each year, however, between April and September, a hail of birds arrives from the surrounding North Pacific.  They squawk and in a frenzy to select nesting sites, defend them from predators, and raise their chicks.  Species include Cassin's and rhinoceros auklets, tufted puffins, common murres, glaucous-winged gulls, pigeon guillemots, pelagic cormorants, black oyster catchers, bald eagles, and peregrine falcons. 

   About one million Cassin's auklets - more than 40 percent of their world population - are the first to arrive.  They burrow under the tufted hair grass and salmonberry bushes that carpet the green and brown landscape.  Like some 84,000 of their rhino cousins, the stubby Cassin's auklets commute each day from ocean feeding waters to hungry chicks waiting in burrows.  They return under the protection of darkness, their unmistakable silhouettes drawn in thick fluttering waves to the steep 210-metre-high hillsides. 

   "It's amazing," remarks Ken Summers, 42, of Aldergrove, who has conducted research at Triangle Island for four years.  "They come in at night and know exactly where to go.  When they leave in the morning, you just hear the wind whistling through their wings." 

   Cassin's auklets are the most prolific breeders among B.C.'s 15 seabird species, with as many as 400 separate burrows in a single 10-metre-square space on Triangle Island. 

   Some 52,000 tufted puffins, the largest colony on the Pacific coast south of Alaska, are active, even brazen, around their burrows during the day.  On congested breeding sites such as Puffin Rock, they circle, holding silvery sand lance crossways in their beaks, orange feet trailing awkwardly, and distinctive locks of pale yellow hair flowing. 

   Crowded together on exposed rocks and cliff ledges, an estimated 10,000 common murres stand penguinlike over their young.  They lean into the rock, shrieking madly, guarding against airborn predators like gulls, crows, eagles, and falcons.  Murres are well-adapted, perhaps too well, to cliff nesting.  Birds that fail to breed continue with their normal nesting behavior as though nothing had happened. 

   "They'll bring in fish and lay them down, or go through all the motions of nesting, even rolling the egg over, with nothing beneath them," says Summers.  Protected from hunters on the west coast, murres remain traditional game birds under Newfoundland's terms of Confederation in 1949, explains Steve Wetmore, B.C.'s chief of migratory birds for the Canadian Wildlife Service.  "They're shot by the boatload on the east coast.  They taste kind of oily, greasy, and fishy. Kind of yucky." 

   Elsewhere on Triangle Island, wide-eyed gull chicks huddle on the uppermost ledges, sizing up the lethal surf below, preparing for a first flight.  On nearby rocks, cormorants stand with waterlogged wings outstretched, as if in worship to the setting sun.  And, with Triangle Island being one of four breeding rookeries in B.C., up to 800 Steller's sea lions writhe about in harems, protecting their wrinkled pups with an incessant chorus of barks and belches. 

   That this treeless, windblown refuge has continued to thrive while some other key seabird sites in B.C. have declined is due as much to its geographic isolation as its prime breeding habitat and abundant marine life.  To date it has avoided the disruption facing nesting sites in the newly created South Moresby National Park Reserve, namely from introduced rats and raccoons, recreational boaters, and uneducated nature lovers. 

   Triangle Island also receives some provincial protection as the Anne Vallee Ecological Reserve, named after a University of British Columbia master's student from Quebec who fell to her death in 1982.  The province issues visitor permits only for scientific and educational purposes, although lack of enforcement staff and penalties makes conformance largely voluntary. 

   The ineffectiveness of current regulations protecting B.C. nesting sites was shown during an 875,000-litre spill of bunker C fuel oil in December, 1988, from the Nestucca barge off Grays Harbor, Wash.   Oil from the barge drifted northward into Canadian waters against the prediction of the U.S. Coast Guard, fouling Vancouver Island's west coast and closing commercial shellfish harvesting.  At least 12,500 seabirds - more than three-quarters of them common murres - were found dead in B.C. and Washington, although the actual kill may be closer to 50,000 birds. 

   Isolated, fist-sized blobs of oil floated with the prevailing currents as far as Triangle Island, more than 500 kilometres north of the spill site.  The experience made a mockery of a federal 10-kilometre exclusion zone around seabird colonies and other land sites in the event offshore oil drilling proceeds on the west coast.  A final decision on drilling awaits a five-year moratorium imposed by the B.C. government in March, 1989, shortly after the Nestucca spill. 

   Concerned about the spill's impact on Triangle Island, the Canadian Wildlife Service hired Summers and fellow researcher Michael Rodway, 38, of Ladner, to conduct a $72,000 census of the nesting seabirds last summer. 

   Dividing the island into sample plots, they scour its surface on hands and knees, checking for egg shells, feces, and feathers that mark an active burrow.  Sometimes they ferret out chicks to determine breeding success.  They also photograph rock cliffs from a five-metre-long inflatable craft, using a telephoto lens, counting the adult birds by putting the photos under a binocular microscope. 

   "This is the main site for murres right here," says Rodway, staggering to focus his lens and pointing to the waterfall of guano pouring off a crowded ledge.  As Summers works the outboard motor against the rising ocean swells, Rodway watches the young murres and adds: "At 20 days, they jump off the cliff.  The males lead them out, and the females, needing to build up their reserves, stay for a couple of extra days." 

   The luxury of studying such abundant wildlife has its own problems.  For example, getting the information without disrupting your subjects can be nerve-wracking.  The island is like a mine field.  A heavy foot can easily collapse shallow burrows, squishing the chick or exposing it to predators.  Researchers made amends by carrying around tiny wooden shingles for quick repairs.  Even approaching too close while photographing the cliffs can spook entire colonies of murres: they tend to exit en masse, like crowds after a concert, and leave their young undefended. 

   While the federal study shows total populations are healthy on Triangle Island, the virtual breeding failure of some 2,000 murres on nearby Castle Rock is possibly linked to the oil spill. 

   Despite the ever-present threat of oil spills and the undetermined impact of both high seas and inshore gill-net fishing, the seabirds' future on Triangle Island looks stable, provided humans keep away .

   Bird research on the island is still in its infancy.  Experience at other irreplaceable wildlife sites, most notably the killer whales rubbing beaches at Robson Bight on northern Vancouver Island, show even small-scale public viewing has a negative impact. 

   In the meantime, the public must be content with seabirds serving a more practical purpose - providing an early-warning system to environmental problems that could affect man. 

   "Often they are the first indication of something going wrong with the food chain," notes Steve Wetmore, holding a gull chick which will probably spend the winter at a garbage dump rather than at the remote landscape where it was born.  </I

    Osoyoos  
  Photography by Karl Spreitz

   The town of Osoyoos bears a revolutionary message for all British Columbia communities, especially those which are always trying to attract a big-industry panacea, like a pulp mill.  The message comes in a promotional videotape the Okanagan Valley town has produced after it had learned its own hard historical lessons. 

   The tape opens with a re-creation of gold rushers coming into the area during the last century, all looking for that elusive pot of gold in creek beds.  They don't find it.  Then they wake up to the realization that the real gold is all around them.  It's the environment.  It's the beauty of the land.  It's the fresh air.  It's the fresh water.  It's the warm climate.  They stay and become settlers. 

   Recent generations in Osoyoos have had to relearn this lesson.  They had fallen prey to the same illusion, but in other form.  We must, they had said to themselves, attract the pot of gold to us.  We must seek industrial development.  Meanwhile, they began to worry about their environment.  They feared raw effluent would begin to make its way into Lake Osoyoos, a gem of a lake - warm, beautiful, filled with fish. 

   Town administrator Lockie Miles chuckles philosophically over what Osoyoos used to do, vainly, to attract industry.  "Like many other B.C. communities, for instance, we got a grant in 1981 under the B.C. Development Plan to build an industrial park.  Initially we had about 10 hot prospects.  Today the park sits fairly empty.  And we paved it, electrified it, and put in sewage lines, and all the services." 

   The seeds of Osoyoos's latter-day awakening go back to 1964.  By a 10-vote margin, residents opted for sewage lagoons on the West Bench, a move that prevented the possibility of septic fields ever polluting Lake Osoyoos.  Then, in 1980, town council had a stroke of genius that made Osoyoos a leader to be imitated.  It put the treated effluent to work.  The purified water, "almost drinkable", now sprinkles a soccer field, the desert Park Racetrack, and the 18-hole Osoyoos Golf and Country Club. 

   "We are now a concerned environmental community," says Miles.  "We like to think we are the most environmentally concerned community in B.C."  He even gets the impression that the attitude of Osoyoos has changed so much that if a pulp mill wanted to locate here the town would say no. 

   This evolution in thinking is paying off, and in unexpected ways.  Tourism has been a mainstay, with some fluctuations, since the mid-1940s, but this past year was sensational.  Over and above this, Osoyoos has recently become a retirement centre.  One-third of the town's citizens are retired, many of them only in their 50s.  As word spreads, it's likely more will select Osoyoos as the place to buy their last home. 

  Osoyoos's setting is indeed idyllic, and it boasts some unusual features.  Even its name is intriguing.  It derives from the Okanagan Indian word Sooyoos, meaning "the narrows" or "the place where two lakes come together."  No one is sure how the name changed by the time Osoyoos become a Hudson's Bay trading post in 1860, but some say that Peter O'Reilly, a magistrate from Hope, jokingly suggested that adding an O would dignify it.

   Downtown Osoyoos sits at the junction of two major roads.  Highway 97 runs north up the Okanagan Valley to Penticton, Kelowna and Vernon, and south across the B.C. - Washington border, Highway 3, the Crowsnest, runs west to Hope, and east over a bridge across the lake toward the Rockies.  It's here, at this bridge, where Osoyoos Lake narrows to become almost two lakes. 

   You can best appreciate the overall landscape by driving up the corkscrewing turns of Highway 3 to the summit of Anarchist Mountain, 1,499 metres.  Osoyoos Lake appears as an oasis amidst the driest land in Canada.  Its shimmering blue waters stretch along the southern end of B.C.'s Okanagan Valley, where the Monashee Mountains roll down from the east and meld with the Thompson Plateau.  Lush green fruit trees embellish the shores, a stark contrast to the parched brown hills on the upper slopes, out of reach of irrigation lines that nourish the lakeside orchards. 

   In the distant south, beyond the international boundary that bisects this 15-kilometre-long lake, the tiny town of Oroville, Washington, sits at the outlet of the lake.  Directly below Anarchist Mountain, the homes and shops of Osoyoos, population 2,956, cluster around the lake.  </I

   CANADIANS GO HOME  

    At a UN conference in Turkey, Ottawa's strident homofeminist agenda provokes an angry counter-attack from the Third World   

   When Canada's delegates to the Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements arrived at their quarters in the posh Istanbul Hyatt three weeks ago, they knew what their mission was: to manipulate yet another UN conference into endorsing far-left social policies that could never be sold openly to their own citizens.  In particular, even though the Habitat II conference was ostensibly about housing issues, the Canadians intended to ensure that feminist goals such as contraception, abortion on demand and school-based sex assistance clinics were enshrined in the conference's final document.  They also planned to battle strenuously for an "inclusive" definition of family that sanctions homosexual unions. 

   Opposing Canada and its allies in the U.S. and European Union delegations were dozens of developing countries which are becoming increasingly enraged over the unrelenting Western campaign to impose degenerate policies on their impoverished and unsuspecting people.  Also opposed was the Vatican delegation and a small but dedicated collection of pro-family and pro-life non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 

   Still, the Canadians had every reason to feel confident.  After all, they had led the successful charge to feminize the final conference documents at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo and last year's Fourth UN Conference on Women in Beijing.  Furthermore, the unprecedented input being granted in Istanbul to feminist NGOs - many of which are directly funded by Western governments - gave Canada's veteran negotiators yet another reason to anticipate easy victory. 

   But things didn't go as planned.  While Habitat II's final document predictably contained a host of references to "environmental sustainability" and other liberal buzz-words, Third World resistance forced the deletion of all significant references to "re-productive health" (abortion) and "sexual health" (mandatory sex instruction). 

   Even more embarrassing, a bid by developing countries to stress the crucial social role of the natural mother-and-father family forced Canadian delegates to reveal their own anti-family program.  This, in turn, earned Canada an unprecedented public condemnation from the Vatican's chief spokesman.  And even a key U.S. delegate felt compelled to complain that Canada's militancy was preventing proper international recognition of parental responsibility. 

   These contentious Canadian manoeuvres abroad are not merely intended to force Western liberalism on "backward" Third Worlders.  The manipulation of the UN process, family advocates warn, is a key component of the Chretien government's strategy to impose social radicalism back at home. 

   The Canadian delegation wasted little time before showing its hand in Istanbul.  After conference-opening formalities were dispensed with on Monday, June 3, delegates got down to deliberations.  Following standard UN conference procedure, a draft document had been prepared at a series of pre-conference meetings known as PrepComs.  Phrases that delegates could not agree on at the final PrepCom had been placed in brackets.  Those phrases would now either be deleted or their brackets removed. 

   Shortly after deliberations began in Committee One, which was charged with resolving most of the contentious passages, nation after nation spoke in favour of removing the brackets around a phrase acknowledging parental responsibilities for children.  But just when it appeared this seemingly innocuous affirmation would be approved, Canada and the European Union objected.  U.S. support for the phrase thereupon wavered, forcing the paragraph in question to be set aside. 

   The Western objections to "parental responsibility" centred around the phrase's alleged failure to conform with the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  That document - which the Alberta government (alone in Canada) has refused to ratify - sets out a number of children's "rights" which exist independently of parents. 

   But when word of the American refusal to endorse parental responsibility seeped back to the U.S., outrage was immediate.  Why, Congressional conservatives demanded, was their country denigrating parents? 

   By Friday, June 7, that anger had borne fruit.  U.S. delegate Mike Stegman told a lobbyist that the American delegation now wanted to endorse parental responsibility, but was being stymied by Canada.  Not until the following week, with Canadian delegates this time maintaining a studious silence, was the phrase finally able to make its way into the document. 

   That muteness by no means signalled a Canadian change of heart, however.  Another paragraph contained a bracketed reference stressing the vital role of the family in human settlements.  Throughout days of heated debate, Canada consistently opposed liberating the phrase from its brackets.  "Family" must be replaced by more "inclusive" language, Canada insisted, to acknowledge "a variety of forms" of families. 

   Since Canada never offered to define which "families" it wished to recognize, delegations from predominantly Catholic and Muslim countries concluded that one objective was to obtain tacit recognition of homosexual partnerships.  They also suspected Canada was deliberately undermining recognition of the foundational role of the two-parent heterosexual marriage. 

   On Thursday, June 13, the deadlocked paragraph was referred to a closed-door "working group" convened to resolve such impasses.  According to three delegates who participated in the private negotiations, the Canadian delegate complained that the family was already over-represented.  "Family" would be referred to three times in the final document, the Canadian huffed, whereas other important terms like "gender" enjoyed only a single mention.  Eventually, the "family" phrase had to be deleted, even though none of the other 168 countries represented in Istanbul had objected. 

   This Canadian insistence on disparaging the traditional family mystified developing-world representatives.  Marthe Lorena de Casco, a Honduran journalist who served on the Vatican delegation, recounted a conversation she had with a female Canadian delegate.  "Your ancestors made Canada what it is with beautiful families that overcame the harsh conditions they faced," Mrs. de Casco told the woman.  "Without the family, you would not have what you have today. Why do you want developing countries not to have good families?"  The Canadian delegate offered no reply, Mrs. de Casco reported. 

   Dr. Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the chief spokesman for Pope John Paul II and the Vatican delegation's press liaison in Istanbul, castigated the Canadian stance at his June 14 conference-closing press conference.  By its consistent opposition to the use of the word family, and its attempt to compare the number of times "family" and "gender" occurred in the document, Canada was in effect arguing that "the family is a concept prejudicial to women," Dr. Navarro-Valls charged. 

   Not only was this anti-family position a contravention of the UN's 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Dr. Navarro-Valls added, it was a prime example of how Western liberals had poisoned the entire Istanbul gathering.  "It is a pity these kinds of discussions, which have nothing to do with Habitat, will compromise the unanimity of the final document." 

   By then, in fact, the revolt of the developing world against the West's homo-feminist agenda had tied up debate for days.  In the conference's first week, the U.S. - firmly backed by Canada - had introduced language recognizing "reproductive health" and "sexual health" services into four additional sites in the Habitat II document. 

   Since Western delegates had deliberately failed to specify what the language really referred to, conservative NGOs quickly tipped the developing world as to what was at stake.  As defined by the World Health Organization, "reproductive health" means providing individuals with access to "means of fertility regulation of their choice."  "Fertility regulation," in turn, includes "interrupting unwanted pregnancies," a euphemism for abortion.  "Sexual health" services, meanwhile, was code for school-based sex instruction. 

   The Western goal was to extract a UN endorsement that could be used to club national and local governments to accept contraception, abortion, and sex-ed services.  But the feminist scenario did not play out as scripted.  Once the real meaning of the phrases was explained, predominantly Catholic and Muslim nations dug in their heels.  Such programs are anathema to their fundamental beliefs, they protested.  Furthermore, Istanbul was supposed to be about human settlements, they noted, not advancing the pro-abortion and anti-family agendas that dominated Cairo and Beijing. 

   Faced with such Third World obstinacy, the Western negotiating juggernaut mobilized all of its resources.  The "Women's Caucus," a collection of feminist NGOs led by former U.S. congressman Bella Abzug's Women's Economic and Development Organization (WEDO), had already been granted unprecedented freedom to lobby delegates.  The feminist NGOs redoubled those efforts while simultaneously making a naked bid to hijack the official NGO document by assuring themselves a preponderance on the roster of of 20 NGO spokesmen slated to address Committee Two delegates dealing with Habitat II's implementation. 

   Both feminist powerplays were thwarted.  Toronto lawyer Gwen Landolt, who chaired the pro-family and pro-life Caucus for Stable Communities, had astutely secured a slot on the NGO's International Facilitating Group after arriving in Istanbul.  When the feminist NGOs tried to import their agenda into the NGO document on June 9, Mrs. Landolt calmly deleted every reference to "re-productive health" and "sexual orientation." 

   And when the feminist NGOs appeared before Committee Two to deliver their pitch the next day, another unpleasant surprise lay in store for them.  After Ms. Abzug and three Women's Caucus partisans delivered the opening NGO addresses, the Vatican successfully petitioned for opposing NGO viewpoints be heard.  Delegates thereupon listened raptly as a battery of conservative NGOs detailed how the entire NGO process had been improperly kidnapped by the feminist caucus with the blessing of UN officials and Western delegates. 

   Mrs. Landolt took the opportunity to point out that many of the supposedly "grass-roots" feminist NGOs were really unrepresentative "phantom" agencies sustained by government funding.  As an example of such handouts, she cited the Canadian government's $40,000 grant to WEDO. 

   Since the previous Thursday, the homo-feminist camp had been waging a campaign of "exhaust and conquer."  Once again, Canada led the way, introducing dozens of amendments to the draft document in an obvious ploy to tire Third World delegates into submission.  Committee One chairman Shafqat Kakakhel declined to condemn openly the Canadian manoeuvre as a stalling tactic, but conceded that it was "undeniable" that "it burdens other delegations with other material." 

   Mercedes Wilson, chief Guatemalan delegate, was less diplomatic.  "What Canada has done is shameful," she commented.  "They are so arrogant.  It would be comical if it wasn't so destructive." 

   Once the Western nations had created an appropriately massive backlog of unresolved paragraphs, they referred as much of the contentious language as possible to the smaller closed-door working groups.  Canada, the U.S. and the EU, who generally controlled the chairmen of these subgroups, tried to obscure the location of the working groups, and restrict provision of translation services.  When this procedural manipulation failed, threats began to suspend crucial aid projector to increase interest rates on development loans. 

   Mrs. Landolt spoke with a Tanzanian delegate who confessed sadly that she was unable to speak out against Western initiatives she opposed.  "If I don't conform, my people will suffer," the delegate said. 

   Abdulaziz Al Khedeiri, one of Saudi Arabia's chief delegates, said that the Western bloc also used a threat to relocate the offices of the UN Commission on Human Settlements from Nairobi as a lever against African delegates.  Mr. Khedeiri added that further pressure was exerted through hints that the developed nations' willingness to ratify the conference goal of devoting 0.7% of gross national product to supporting human settlements was contingent upon adopting the West's social platform. 

   British Secretary of State for the Environment John Gummer, the head of the British delegation, was the sole Western leader to condemn this bullying publicly.  In a private interview, Mr. Gummer denounced "the imperialistic view of poor people who live a long way away." 

   But unlike in Beijing and Cairo, the West's bullying and obfuscation proved largely unavailing.  Led by Saudi Arabia, which was immune to western economic threats, developing nations forced the deletion of one "re-productive health" reference after another.  At 7 a.m. on Friday, after developing-world representatives had rebuffed a last-ditch Western ploy to sneak its abortion and sex-education agenda past exhausted delegates under the guise of a "health" definition lifted from the Beijing document, U.S. delegate Melinda Kimble stalked from the Committee One meeting room shaking with rage. 

   When the dust settled, one "reproductive health" reference had survived, as did language endorsing "family planning".  But at Saudi insistence, the unimpeded right of countries to interpret all aspects of the Habitat document in the context of their individual cultural, religious and ethical values was explicitly confirmed. 

   As the conference wound down, criticism of the efforts of Canada and other Western nations was widespread.  </I
   The Saute-Mouton slips beneath Route 112's Victoria Bridge, the longest in the world at the time of its completion in 1859 and the first to span the St. Lawrence.  The boat then eases past the Cubist modules of Moishe Safdie's Habitat apartment complex, stacked on the riverbank to the left like a child's building blocks.  Habitat was built as an "experiment in urban living" for Expo 67, Montreal's vastly successful world's fair.  The skeletal frame of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome, another vestige of the fair, peeks above the foliage of Ile Ste-Helene, one of a dozen islets strewn like stepping stones along the length of the city.  Finally, the passengers are deposited back at Quai Victoria. 

   On first impression, Montreal seems foreign to the North American continent, a European city somehow run aground on alien shores.  In the past decade or so, this aesthetic aspect (combined with an exceptionally favorable exchange rate) has made the metropolis a bustling backlot for American filmmakers looking for the streets of Rome or Paris only six hours from Hollywood.  For any European visitor, strolling through Place Jacques-Cartier or Square Dorchester is an oddly familiar experience.  Surely, the City Hall is a copy of the Hotel de Ville in Paris, and the Mary Queen of the World Basilica a miniature of St. Peter's in Rome? 

   Yet to North Americans, there's no mistaking Montreal for any other city on the continent: raffish, risque, carefree, a wide-open town, nightclubs packed till all hours.  Certifiably French, foreign.  An exotic place, romantic, sensual, its past filled with adventure and colorful characters. 

   Montreal is a city of diversity and complexity, with a non-French ethnic population that is a mixture of English and a hundred other minorities.  Greeks, Italians, Portuguese, and Jews each have a community 100,000-strong.  There are Asians and Haitians too.  Montreal is also cosmopolitan, fashionable, intellectual, a political hotbed, a university town, bohemian, a mecca for artists and nonconformists who gather here to slip the stifling bonds of provincialism.  And it is a cultured city that supports fine-arts museums, two symphonies, ballet companies, an opera company, and French and English theater.  Not to mention the Festivale de Theatre des Ameriques biennial, which takes over the city every odd year and has established an international reputation for presenting superior avant-garde and over-the-edge theater. 

   As in France, dining out in Montreal tends to be a ritual: The best meals are evening-long affairs with a late start, uncounted courses, unrestrained conversation, uninhibited conviviality.  The city's cafe society, perhaps the largest on the continent, thrives on Bishop, Crescent, Laurier, St-Denis, St-Laurent (the Main), St-Paul, and half a dozen other lively thoroughfares.  In summer, these cafes en plein air - more than 400 at last count - may be the quintessential Montreal social forum.  Striped awnings are unrolled; bright umbrellas bloom above sidewalk tables.  A jug of sangria, a carafe of wine, a mug of beer, and spirited companions combine with a comfortable setting for watching the world go by and savoring the precious days and evenings of the few warm months.  Montreal is indeed theatrical, extroverted, and gregarious. 

   This vivacious city is on a roll.  Peaceful cooperation between the French and les autres once again predominates, except for the die-hard factions on either side.  The Parti Quebecois of the late Rene Levesque was a painful but necessary instrument for asserting the primacy of French language and culture in the province of its North American birth.  The last decade has seen the ascendancy of a well-educated, bilingual Quebecois business class that has displaced priests, politicians, lawyers, and bureaucrats as the province's elite. 

   This new generation of Quebecois has shattered long-time Anglophone domination of the province, even elbowing into le haute monde.  A society-page roster of a recent Hunt Club soiree at the Ritz (what could be more Anglo?) reads like a Who's Who of Francophone high society, with a sprinkling of WASPs for old time's sake.  Culturally and economically, the Quebecois are confidently maitres chez nous. 

   For the most part, the province and the city have turned from cultural affairs to economic ones.  The FOR SALE/ A VENDRE signs that sprouted like mushrooms on front lawns in predominantly English-speaking neighborhoods during the threatening days of separatism have been replaced with the signs of a vigorous economy flexing its muscles after a decade of political confinement - soaring property values, gentrification of run-down neighborhoods, new Metro (subway) lines, new museums, a downtown construction boom.  Montreal, en forme encore. 

   The Montreal street grid is actually oriented on a northeast-southwest axis, but no one in the city follows that.  The convention is that rue Sherbrooke runs east-west, and boulevard St-Laurent (The Main) runs north-south.  So, for example, Universite de McGill is west of St-Laurent, and Vieux-Montreal and the river are at the southern end of town. 

   Vieux-Montreal (Old Montreal)  

   From Quai Victoria, the patinated spires and gleaming domes in Vieux-Montreal present an essentially antique picture; the eye willingly overlooks the dissonant details of modernity.  At the district's eastern extremity a copper statue of the Virgin Mary stands behind the tiny Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours chapel .  Known also as the sailors' chapel, its roofline is cluttered with steeple and tower.  This is the 1773 Our Lady of the Harbour, celebrated in the song "Suzanne" by Montrealer Leonard Cohen.  Beside the church shines the silver dome of Bonsecours Market, Canada's Parliament from 1849 to 1852 and, for decades following, Montreal's principal market (it now houses municipal offices).  On a slight elevation behind Bonsecours' classical facade rises the Second Empire roof of City Hall, where, on a third-floor balcony in 1967, Charles de Gaulle fanned the flames of separatism with his disruptive exhortation, "Vive le Quebec libre!"  Farther west, sunlight gleams off the white cupola of the former Palais de Justice.  Still farther west, twin Gothic spires nicknamed Temperance and Perseverance soar above the nave of Notre-Dame Basilica, cynosure of the Roman-Catholic faithful since 1829. 

   Behind these archaisms, the more familiar North American cityscape to the north and northwest reaffirms itself in concrete apartment buildings and office high-rises, undistinguished except for the anodized elegance of the Bourse de Montreal (Stock Exchange Tower) and the cruciform mass of Place Ville-Marie.  Then the eye looks deeper into the scene and alights on another of Montreal's unique views: Behind the downtown spires, Mont Royal lifts a leafy crown bejeweled with a metal cross, the thematic antecedent of Place Ville-Marie. 

   But this view is fast-changing: Both the expanded Palais des Congres de Montreal convention center and the World Trade Centre office-retail and hotel complex will open in 1991.  The latter will occupy several city blocks in Vieux-Montreal, including rue St-Jacques, formerly the "Wall Street" of Canada.  By then, the area will be home to two other megascale commercial projects: A $250-million, 51-story office tower project with a winter garden and year-round outdoor skating rink a la New York's Rockefeller Center will be nestled between Place Bonaventure and Place du Canada.  Rivalling it will be the 45-story IBM-Marathon building, facing the Sheraton Centre, that will feature an adjoining eight-story winter garden. 

   The waterfront area has also undergone critical development in the past six years, critical because the harborside and rue de la Commune form the southern boundary of Vieux-Montreal - cradle of the city, its greatest tourist attraction, and, second only to Quebec City's Place Royale, a repository of the nation's past.  The 95-acre historic district extends west to rue McGill, east to rue Berri, and north to rue St-Antoine - roughly corresponding to the perimeter of the old walls of the city. 

   More changes are in store, planned to coincide with the city's 350th-anniversary celebration in 1992.  The Montreal Archeology and History Centre, opening near Place Royale at the precise site of the first European settlement in Montreal, is part of a scheme that will restore Montreal's waterfront to its former glory. 

   Most of the architecture here is Victorian, although there remain enough crooked alleys and cockeyed houses from earlier eras to proclaim the district's 350 years of habitation.  The old quarter is enclosed and intimate, the scale human.  Around every corner a new scene presents itself - a confusion of ancient masonry and fire escapes, a carriageway leading to an enclosed courtyard, a curving row of century-old gray-stone buildings (no two of them alike), a blue sliver of the St. Lawrence glimpsed between dwellings. 

   Since the area's revival in the 1960s, scores of field-stone dwellings and warehouses along the narrow streets have been scrubbed down and renovated; they are now occupied by shops, restaurants, clubs, businesses, studios, museums, and private homes.  The venerable quartier has become a vibrant place in which to live, work, eat, and play. 

   There's little danger that Vieux-Montreal will turn into a touristy museum piece like New York City's South Street Seaport or Boston's Faneuil Hall-Quincy Market.  Even when it was down at the heels, this was still a working neighborhood, with banks along rue St-Jacques, law offices and courthouses on rue Notre-Dame, and, along lesser thoroughfares, import-export companies, shipping firms, photography studios, book publishers, printers, nightclubs, restaurants, even a costume emporium. 
 

   After its revival, Vieux-Montreal was still cut off from the river - its lifeline since the 17th century - by fenced dockyards, railroad tracks, and a phalanx of five grain elevators that seemed to crush the old city with their mass.  Then, in the late 1970s, the bulk of the dockyard operations shifted several miles east.  Down came the fences and the elevators.  What remained were the railroad tracks, several hangars, and four empty piers as broad as aircraft-carrier decks: Alexandra, King Edward, Jacques-Cartier, and Victoria.  The river had been "returned" to the city, and a great debate began: What to do with this wonderful new resource? 

   Fortunately, the city spurned the usual pressure to construct a megaproject and instead chose a modest, step-by-step plan.  Two phases have thus far produced grassy, landscaped expanses, ponds, and flower-filled planters on both sides of the tracks; grade crossings for pedestrians; cycling paths; and renovation of the 1922 Sailor's Memorial Tower at the tip of Victoria Pier. 

   People drift down from Place Jacques-Cartier, the heart of Vieux-Montreal, to stroll around the piers or rent bicycles and quadricycles.  Clowns, jugglers, musicians, balloon sculptors, and food vendors add to the festive air as a once moribund part of town comes alive with activity.  Concerts take place on summer nights beneath a big-top tent on Quai Jacques-Cartier; later in the evening, the musical torch is passed to Quebecois   chanteurs performing on a beer-garden boat docked at the end of the pier. 

   A flea market occupies part of former Hangar No. 8, while the hangar's upper level is devoted to one of the Vieux-Port's two major annual summer exhibitions, Images du Futur.  This international showcase highlights the latest technological advances in the visual arts: laser and video displays, computer graphics, holography, sound-and-light-wave sculptures, computer-synthesized sound-scapes, and multi-sensory, multi-media installations.  Each year the exhibition presents a different country's artists, cultural organizations, and corporations.  Next door in Hangar No. 9 is Expotec, an equally popular annual exhibition presenting interactive displays about the latest scientific research and technological developments of interest to the general public.  Attracting some 300,000 people, the 1990 exhibition was about sports of every kind.  Also here is the 7-story-high, 70-foot-wide IMAX Super Cinema screen, which presents films year-round. 

   Those who would like to see Canada at work can tour the Great Lakes freighter Maplecliffe Hall, which carries grain from Thunder Bay to a deep-sea transfer terminal at Baie-Comeau on the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; from late June to early September, business is slow, so the owners dock the Maplecliffe at the Vieux-Port and welcome visitors on board. 

   Until the 1960s, Place Jacques-Cartier, a cobbled rectangle sloping down from the ornate City Hall to rue de la Commune, was the city's busiest open-air market (the only reminders of this function are flower stands on a narrow median).  Today the plaza justifiably remains the focal point of Vieux-Montreal.  Place Jacques-Cartier can be magical, especially on a warm summer night, with the splashing Vauquelin fountain, the shadowy columns on the City Hall's floodlit facade, the sidewalk vendors and street musicians, the caleches drawn by stoic nags snuffling battered oat bags.  </I
   METRAC: A Catalyst for Change  

   METRAC (The Metro Action Committee on Public Violence Against Women and Children) was established in 1984 by the council of Metropolitan Toronto.  It succeeds a task force initiated by the council in 1982 to address the concerns of women in Toronto after a series of rape-murders in the city. 

   The task force involved 80 volunteer members from a wide range of backgrounds: doctors, lawyers, politicians, police, social workers, urban planners, workers from rape crisis centres, and other women's organizations.  They established a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach which METRAC has carried forward in its work on violence prevention. 

   The recommendations of the task force were both extensive and far-sighted.  METRAC's function, therefore, is to act as a catalyst for the implementation of these recommendations addressing criminal justice, policing, support services, public education and urban planning. 

   Since its inception, METRAC has been able to rely on the support of municipal politicians for its advocacy work.  In fact, METRAC carries out extensive consulting work with all three levels of government, as well as with community groups and the media to develop pioneering initiatives, programs, policies and practices to enhance the safety of women and children in Metro Toronto. 

   Context  

   Women's safety is affected by a multitude of factors.  These include: public understanding of sexual assault; urban design; treatment of offenders by the criminal justice system; the impact of pornography; and standards of professional conduct.  In Canada, the sexual victimization of women and children is pervasive; often it is only nominally discouraged.  It is crucial that we admit this and acknowledge that women's fears are based in reality.  As we women go about our daily lives in the city, we know when we feel unsafe, and why.  METRAC stresses the importance of consulting with women as a primary step in any project undertaken to make the city a safer place. 

   As an organization, METRAC is informed by women's experience, guided by a carefully developed analysis, committed to the eradication of violence and energized by recognition of the need for change. 

   Working in the areas of prevention and education, METRAC has recommended and launched many initiatives.  With the long-term goal of 24-hour safe access to the city, METRAC has placed women's safety and security issues firmly on the public agenda. 

   A Blueprint for Municipal Action  

   Much of the work done by METRAC has an important crime-prevention component.  Since assault by a stranger is, to some extent, a crime of opportunity, various physical/geographical features may enhance or detract from the use of a particular site for assault.  A number of METRAC's pilot projects, therefore, concentrate on urban design.  They include the following: 

    1. The WISE report   

  This was a groundbreaking project designed to document women's concerns about urban planning and design.  With support from Women Plan Toronto and the Faculty of Environmental Studies, York University, METRAC interviewed many women (including single mothers, older, immigrant and disabled women).  Their safety and security concerns form the basis of Women in Safe Environments ("the WISE report").

    2. Lighting in underground garages   

   METRAC successfully encouraged the establishment of a City of Toronto committee to review the standards of illumination and security in underground garages in Toronto.  Over two years, the committee's work has resulted in an amended by-law and higher illumination levels, improved signage, the whitewashing of all walls and the installation of new door-locking devices. 

    3. Safety audit of the transit system   

   Together with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and the Metro Toronto Police Force, METRAC initiated a safety audit of the 65 stations in the subway system.  This involved assessment of the safety, accessibility and distance from help of parts of the station buildings and grounds and was aimed at sexual assault prevention.  The 63 recommendations of the report have been adopted by the TTC, and audits of surface routes in the transit system have begun. 

    4. Safety audit of High Park   

   METRAC conducted safety audits of Toronto's largest park and made extensive recommendations designed to improve its safety for the women and children who use it. 

    5. Development of Safety Audit Kit  

   Recognizing that women limit their use of public and semipublic spaces when they feel unsafe, METRAC has developed a safety audit kit which women can use to analyse and document their safety concerns in the city, in their home neighbourhood or in their workplace. 

    6. Police training   

   Working with the Metro Toronto Police Force, METRAC has developed training programmes for sexual assault investigators and other police personnel to increase police sensitivity to sexual assault survivors.  The improved quality of investigations and consequent increase in reporting rate for sexual assault cases will have significant results for crime prevention. 

    7. The "Safe City" project   

   With impetus and information from METRAC, City of Toronto politicians produced an urban safety report, Safe City: Municipal Strategies to Prevent Violence Against Women and Children.  With the aid of the Safe City Committee, recommendations from the report are currently being implemented .

    8. Design guidelines   

   METRAC is currently preparing a discussion paper on women's safety and urban standards in order to facilitate the development of criteria for guidelines and standards for all buildings in the city: construction and renovation projects; shopping centres and housing projects; parks; and all other public and semipublic spaces. 

    9. In the schools   

   With schoolboards and educators, METRAC is working on both curriculum development and staff training in the area of violence prevention, together with the institution of supportive policies. 

    10. Community work   

   METRAC initiated a series of community-based conferences called Stopping Rape to raise awareness and prompt action at a community level.  METRAC has also supported greater access to Wen-Do self-defence programmes in schools, recreation centres and community buildings, noting especially that these need to be accessible for disabled women. 

   Conclusion  

   It is METRAC's experience that when city officials and urban planners and designers think about safety, their thoughts turn to fire and traffic regulations.  There is a tendency to overlook the necessity to create an environment which can be safely used and which, by deliberate planning and assessment, reduces the likelihood of attack and assault. 

   Those who are in any way vulnerable - children, women, disabled or elderly people - still have the right to safe access to the city they live in.  The explicit addressing of women's concerns about safety and sexual assault prevention results in urban design which enhances everyone's safety.

    WOMEN TAKING SPACE   

   Many women never go out alone after dark.  Many try to arrange for friends to meet them at the bus stop, or spend scarce dollars on taking a cab.  Many women who work shifts in low-paying jobs cannot make either of these arrangements.  When we do go out, we avoid places that we judge to be unsafe.  Women simply do not have the freedom of movement in the city that most men enjoy without question: our use of public space is deeply affected by the pervasive threat of sexual assault. 

   Between a third and half of these sexual assaults take place in urban public space.  Unfortunately, the image of sexual assault by a stranger in a public place has all too often been that of a deranged man lurking in the bushes.  Similarly, the assault has often been blamed on the woman who is its victim: she was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, in the wrong clothes, acting in the wrong ways.  Endless work of feminist organizations over the decades has begun to debunk this mythology, although sadly there is still a lot of work to do. 

   Changing the environment to fit our needs can be one step in the fight against violence against women.  When it comes to women's safety, women have the knowledge and expertise that the "professionals" lack.  It does not require a degree in planning or design to recognise what makes a place unsafe and threatening.  It requires relevant experience, and women have a lifetime's worth of that.  </I

    The City for Women: No Safe Place  
  by Linda MacLeod  

    One in four women in Canada can expect to be sexually assaulted at some point in their lives, one half of these women before the age of 17. 

   One million women in Canada are abused by their husbands or live-in lovers each year. 

   15% of all homicides are murders of women by their husbands, but only 6% of all homicides are murders of men by their wives. 

   About 100,000 women in Canada are assaulted by someone other than their husbands or ex-husbands each year.   

   Violence is Part of Many Women's Lives  

   Women live in realistic fear of this high risk of violence.  56% of urban Canadian women feel unsafe walking alone in their own neighbourhoods after dark, while only 18% of men said they feel unsafe in the same circumstances.  Women's fear is escalated not only by their high risk of violence, but because the nature of women's victimization gives women the strong message that there is no safe place for them and no one they can trust. 

   Inequality Increases Fear  

   Women's fears are further escalated by daily experiences, responsibilities and perceptions which are tied to negative social values surrounding women's bodies and sexuality, to women's unequal economic and social status in our society and to their primary responsibility for the care of children.  Women's common experiences with sexual harassment as well as demeaning portrayals of women and their sexuality in the media and in billboard advertising, contribute to women's feelings of being at risk .

   Violence Has More Serious Consequences for Women  

   Women who are victims of violence suffer higher risks of serious injuries and trauma than men who are victims of violence.  Women who are victims of violence are more likely to suffer economic hardship than men who are victims of violence.  Women who are abused by their husbands may be forced to flee their homes, possessions and economic security to escape the violence.  Because women are more likely to be poor than are men, they are also less able to afford needed repairs, medical procedures and/or counselling necessitated by their victimization. 

   When women who are victims of violence seek help from legal, health and social services, they frequently find the services insensitive to their particular form of victimization or their experiences as women.  Many women report an experience of "double victimization" at the hands of helping agencies.  Immigrant, visible minority and disabled women also report that available services are often unknown to them and, even where they are known, are inaccessible because of language barriers, physical barriers, discrimination and/or the lack of specialized services to meet their particular needs. 

   How Does Your City Lose?  

   Fear exaggerates the inequality between rich and poor because the rich can afford sophisticated security systems and protection, leaving the poor even more vulnerable to crime, relatively speaking.  Withdrawal leaves the streets open to criminal behaviour, and contributes eventually to deteriorating business conditions.  The quality of life of the entire community is eroded, city life becomes devalued, degraded, and the collapse of the community eventually becomes inevitable. 

   We Need Municipal Leadership Now!  

   If the demise of our urban centres is to be reversed, women's fear and victimization must be reduced.  Strong political will is needed to energize local, provincial/territorial, national and international communities. 

   We must build strategies for change rooted in an acceptance of the validity and appropriateness of women's fear.  We must build change through the promotion of women's rights to safety, dignity, respect, justice, empowerment and involvement in the community.  Municipal politicians are connected to the lives of their constituents and are empowered to coordinate and mobilize their communities.

   the best doctors money can buy  
  A privileged minority is using private insurance to jump the health-care queue 
  By Kyle Stone 

   Dr. M. is a noted urologist practising in a large Toronto hospital in a suite of offices he shares with several others.  Yet these offices are as quiet as if they were in a private clinic.  The chairs are soft.  The attractive young assistants and secretaries dress well; with patients and doctors alike, they remain honey-voiced and discreet.  Dr. M. and his colleagues specialize in prostate patients, some of them high-profile ones: the offices are full of bankers and lawyers and big investors. 

   Unlike his colleagues, however, Dr. M. is a member of a specialist-referral network, a group of doctors organized and hired by a company known as an independent medical-assessment service.  These companies recruit doctors from big hospitals and small clinics: cardiologists, urologists, psychiatrists, back doctors, ophthalmologists; specialists in livers and kidneys and glands, in impotence and gastrointestinal problems.  They recruit clients too: companies that offer their employees access to the service through the company insurance plan.  The assessment service then sends the employee to one doctor or another within the network.  It promises rapid medical attention, guaranteed. 

   "Rapid medical attention" means calling up a doctor, usually on short notice, and asking if there's a time slot available for, say, a checkup that afternoon.  If a time isn't available with the first member doctor, the assessment service will place the client with another.  But since the doctors are paid, by some estimates, nearly twice as much for some procedures as they would get from the public health-insurance plan, the first doctor called is almost always available.  If an ordinary medicare patient is scheduled for that time slot, and his visit is not a medical emergency, Dr. M.'s secretary will call with the regretful news of the doctor's urgent staff meeting or nasty cold or sudden personal family crisis.  The visit will be postponed, and the matter will stay between the doctor and his secretary, the one who keeps his appointment book. 

   Every so often, someone from Dr. M.'s particular medical-assessment company comes by to drop off some forms for him to fill out.  When Dr. M. hired a new secretary recently, the company's representative came by to tell her about the basic arrangement.  "The basic arrangement," says Fred Holmes, a health-benefits consultant with the firm Towers, Perrin, who is familiar with assessment companies, "is to book some time with a group of specialists.  They say, 'okay, we'll pay you these dollars, and we get bumping privileges in your list.' "  And their clients get to jump the queue.  A health-insurance executive in Waterloo, Ontario, describes assessment companies as having "developed a network of expert bastards that are resident in our [health-care] system, that are prepared to take private billings and do private physicals.  And they've found a legal way to do it."  Indeed they have.  While former office workers describe Dr. M. as "crowing" about all the money he can make this way, they say he is especially proud of one thing - it's all completely legal. 

   Dr. M. is not alone in his desire to make more money.  Caps and clawbacks on their fees have many doctors, particularly specialists, on the warpath.  In Ontario this summer, both obstetricians and orthopaedic surgeons threatened service cuts if the governing Tories didn't revoke these caps, and a coalition of specialists advised its members to stop accepting new patients after October 1. 

   Nor is Dr. M. alone in heeding the siren call of private medical services.  The Canadian Medical Association put private funding for health care - in other words, two-tier medicine - back on the agenda of its annual conference.  (Its members had voted down the issue in 1994.)  Dr. M., though, has found a simpler way into the world of private medicine.  In expansive moments, he's confided that he's found a loophole in the system, one that, as Fred Holmes puts it, "is, or can be, mammoth." 

   The loophole is this: the Canada Health Act guarantees all Canadians universal and equal access to medically necessary services.  But it also contains something called the "Exclusion Paragraph." The Exclusion Paragraph has two main points.  One, if a company pays workers'-compensation premiums, then its employees' job-related injuries and illnesses are paid for by Workers' Compensation, and not by the provincial health-insurance plan.  Two, if an employer, or a life-, disability-, or auto-insurance company requires you to have a medical checkup, that checkup is not considered "medically necessary."  Instead it's called a third-party payer procedure, and, again, provincial health plans won't cover it. 

   Clearly, the Exclusion Paragraph was designed to keep the system honest: Workers' Comp pays for work-related medical problems; third parties - employers and insurers - pay for what they require; and the public system pays for everything else that's medically necessary, for everyone.  Ironically, the Exclusion Paragraph has also served to open a window of opportunity for doctors to make more money than they would in the public system, by doing private or "third-party" work.  That's why specialist-referral networks and medical-assessment services have sprung up and are growing quickly.  OHIP, for instance, pays a doctor $51.40 for a "consultation," $105.40 for a "consultation for respiratory disease."  (Every provincial health plan has its own schedule of fees.)  But if a service is provided on a private basis, the fee is whatever the doctor and the third party, whether it's an insurer or an assessment company, agree to. 

   So doctors have an incentive to look for private work Assessment-service companies operate as middlemen, working between the employer and the doctor, or between the employer's insurance company and the doctor.  (Perhaps because of this, not all insurance companies look kindly on medical-assessment services.  Some prefer to build their own stable of doctors directly.)  There are assessment companies, like Rapid-Med, that work only with life-, auto-, and health-insurance companies, hiring doctors to do pre-employment medicals and the checkups needed for long-term disability-insurance claims.  Others, like Medcan Health Management Inc., offer comprehensive in-house checkups for executives, disability-claims assessment for injured line workers, and a specialist-referral network that in some cases bypasses the insurance company altogether to form its own exclusive triangle: employer, high-ranking executive employee, and specialist-network physician. 

   The idea is to get patients diagnosed faster than provincial medicare can manage.  Of course, if these patients had stayed in the public health-care system, they would be waiting in line precisely because the checkups they need aren't considered medically necessary.  An irony of assessment companies is that they can get their clients a procedure that's not considered urgent faster than one that is. 

   The clients who take advantage of the kind of organized queue-jumping assessment services offer can be divided into several major groups.  There are the employers who are frustrated and want their sick or hurt employee back to work.  They'd also like to make sure the employee isn't just faking it.  There are auto-insurance companies who want their claimants diagnosed as quickly as possible.  And there are employers who provide access to specialist networks as a perk to a select senior-management group. 

   What they get is preferred access to top specialists like Dr. M., and checkups that are more leisurely and that can be more comprehensive than those offered to regular medicare patients.  There is also the benefit, for both patient and doctor, of networking over the stethoscope - of chumminess and social cachet. 

   Dr. Bob Francis has been president of Medcan since the mid-1970s.  As Francis seems to be the godfather of specialist networks, I expected a chat with the Prince of Darkness when I phoned him up.  Instead, he sounded kindly and a little befuddled, more like Mr. Magoo than Dr. Doom.  After outlining his company's specialist-referral network for me, Dr. Francis told me earnestly, "I don't call that two-tiered medicine.  I call that access to care in a meaningful way."  Francis, in other words, claims he's simply helping his clients down a different avenue to certain medical services.  When I asked him if that didn't amount to helping his clients nose in ahead of public patients waiting to see the same doctors, he had clearly been waiting for the question. 

  "The way I answer that is, what's not recognized ... is that he [the doctor] doesn't bump OHIP patients.  OHIP has already decreed that he can see only so many patients per month.  And by he or she seeing one of our patients it actually frees up a spot for another OHIP patient.  So, if anything, it has the reverse effect.  You're also freeing up some dollars.  The person who's coming through our system is actually helping to subsidize the system." 

   Dr. Philip Berger, a family practitioner in downtown Toronto who has cultivated a reputation as a critic of the medical establishment, snorts at the notion that private service speeds the public system along.  "Other people will have a longer, not a shorter, wait, because the doctors aren't available, because the wealthy and the beneficiaries of insurance plans keep pushing themselves in.  If you're standing in line at a movie theatre and someone in a white fox coat hurries to the head of the line and goes inside and calls back over their shoulder, 'see, the line is shorter now,' would you believe it?" 

   Fred Holmes muses: "Yep.  It's delicate ..  You are slipping people in.  But, you know, a doctor has the total choice, in his office practice, to choose who he sees and who he doesn't see, and who he stays late for, and who he slips in first thing in the morning." 

   Those in the medical-assessment business simply do not concede that this causes problems.  Alexander Gourley, president of Health Resource Management Ltd., a "diagnostic and assessment facilitator" that works in Alberta, defends his business in much the same way as Bob Francis, depicting it as a nonthreatening departure from medicare.  HRM, he stresses, covers only diagnostic assessments - which aren't covered under Alberta Health - and not the treatments themselves, which are.  "Any of the services we require are, by definition, uninsured," Gourley says.  "When a patient requires a treatment service covered by a provincial health plan, then they're treated as equally as anyone else.  They bill the Alberta health-insurance plan.  And we don't influence their movement through the queue.  What we're looking for is a return-to-work diagnostic assessment.  Then we negotiate terms and conditions with doctors, as does everyone else." 

   This raises a few questions, however.  Isn't "expediting and facilitating specialist referral" to "establish or confirm diagnosis and duration of disability" as Gourley describes his company's services, still just a nice way to say paying for faster medical attention?  And once a patient has jumped ahead for a referral, isn't his treatment inevitably speeded up as well, even if it is done in the public system?  As Philip Berger, in discussing the private sector's impact on the public one, points out: "A doctor can't sit there and say 'Well, the only reason you're here is because your employer sent you, therefore I'm not going to listen to your chest.  I'm not going to pay attention to the fact you're drenched in sweat and hot.'  You have an obligation to do something for them, if that is the case." 

   And can we really be sure that all these private patients are slipped in at the end of the day, or first thing in the morning, as assessment companies claim?  If they're not, if a regular OHIP patient waiting to have a medically necessary service performed has to wait longer because the doctor's in with someone whose appointment is not medically necessary, common sense says that this amounts to organized queue-jumping, and that it contravenes at least the spirit, if not the letter, of the Canada Health Act.  

   And is there always a hard and fast distinction made between diagnosis and treatment?  Or might doctors, particularly specialists protected by the privacy of their offices, be persuaded to provide a medically necessary service faster, and off-OHIP, as it were, if the price were right? 

   The very existence of this alternative, private avenue to medical service, never mind its growth in recent years, opens the door to all kinds of abuses that are difficult to track.  Jim Pare, Workers' Comp specialist at the Ontario Federation of Labour, says he knows of injured line workers who have been pressured into filing disability-insurance claims rather than filing Workers' Compensation claims, and so receiving a far smaller settlement.  (Because a company's Workers' Comp premiums rise dramatically the more claims it files, it's often cheaper in the long run for the company to do this).  Fred Holmes says he has heard of an assessment service trying to convince companies that, so long as they are paying Workers' Compensation premiums for their line workers, then all their employees are eligible to have their medical services handled outside medicare.  That provides justification, in other words, for having their executives treated by specialist-referral network on a private basis, even for medically necessary services.  "Then you're into a world of illegal acts, as I understand the law," says Holmes.  

   Third-party-payer procedures also create at least the potential for doctors to bill the public system for services performed, and paid for, on a private basis.  Al Gourley, the president of HRM Ltd., insists: "We deal with people who are first class, and whose integrity would never, never allow them to be so compromised."  But the fact remains that there's no way of knowing for sure, and critics charge that, in Ontario at least, the government seems to be little concerned with enforcing third-party-payer procedure laws.  "I have to admit," says Ontario Ministry of Health spokesman Paul Kilbertus, "We're not working too quickly towards it.  But it is something we're committed to doing.  It's never been a grey zone.  It's been clear that we're not supposed to pay ...  In Ontario, the health professions are self-regulating.  If they're billing twice," he concedes, "there's no way we're going to know about it.  Private companies don't tell us what doctors are billing them for."  

   And as for Bob Francis's contention that private service can save the public system money, the opposite is more likely to be the case.  

    INTRODUCTION   

   As our population grows older, profound implications will arise for Canadian society.  Many important public issues are and will be emerging as a result.  

   This booklet is an attempt to profile Canada's seniors as they are and as they see themselves.  It is not intended to provide a comprehensive description, but rather an overall perspective on the seniors population .

   As seniors themselves well know, there are many inaccurate perceptions and even stereotypes about aging in our society.  We often view aging as a process that begins later in life, usually around age 65.  Those who have passed that age, then, are often regarded as passive and dependent, rather than as active and independent members of society. 

   Such generalizations completely miss the fact that aging is a lifelong process which encompasses a whole series of changes from birth to death.  There exists no sudden or artificial transition to old age.  Even many of the changes usually associated with aging, such as greying hair, begin long before seniors status is acquired at age 65. 

   The following presentation will challenge some of the commonly held myths and misperceptions about seniors.  The perspective here is drawn from statistical data, but behind the statistics are the lives of almost three million Canadians who are an integral and dynamic part of our society. 

    1 THE NUMBER OF SENIORS CONTINUES TO GROW   

   The aging of the baby boom generation, combined with a dramatic decline in the birth rate since the early 1960s, will mean further growth in the proportion of Canada's seniors population well into the next century.  Falling mortality rates will also continue adding to the number of seniors.  The proportion of seniors who are over 85 will continue to increase.  But the ratio of women to men, which has grown rapidly since the early 1960s, will decline.  

   In 1986, 2.7 million Canadians were over 65; that's 11 per cent of our population, compared to 6 per cent in 1931. 

   By the year 2031, the percentage of seniors could rise to 22 per cent of the population or 7.5 million Canadians. 

 

   The proportion of seniors in the provinces ranges from 13 per cent in Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and Saskatchewan to 9 per cent in Newfoundland, 8 per cent in Alberta and 4 per cent in the Yukon Territories.  By the year 2000, provincial variations are expected to converge toward the national average. 

   Seniors in Canada constitute a smaller percentage of the population than do seniors in many other industrialized countries.  In Sweden, seniors make up 17 per cent of the population, in the United Kingdom 15 per cent and in the United States 12 per cent. 

   Among seniors, the percentage of those over 80 could grow from 20 per cent in 1986 to 25 per cent in 2001. 

   Life expectancy continues to increase.  Life expectancy at birth for women is 80 years, up from 74 in the early 1960s; for men it is 73 years, up from 68 in the early 1960s. 

   At age 65, a woman can expect to live 19 more years and a man 15 more years. 

   There are 120 women for every 100 men in the 65-69 age group.  Among those 85 and over, there are 229 women for every 100 men. 

 

    2 MUCH DIVERSITY AMONG SENIORS   

   Seniors as a group are not homogeneous.  The differences among them in health, marital status, housing, income and ethnicity are as great as they are among younger Canadians.  The living situations of older women often differ considerably from men of the same age.  As Canadians live longer, this diversity will continue to grow.  The designation of "65 and over" for seniors is becoming increasingly arbitrary. 

   Seniors, like other Canadians, are of different generations, each with their own history of social experiences.  Some, for example, have experienced the First World War; others' memories do not pre-date the Depression.  In addition to a particular set of social experiences, seniors, as a group, differ from younger Canadians in several ways: 

   Eleven per cent of Canadians over 65 speak neither English nor French at home - nearly double the percentage of those under 50. 

   Older Canadians are more likely to be of British origin than are younger ones.  Fifty-five per cent of those 80 and over are of British descent compared to 39 per cent of those under 65. 

   Older Canadians are less likely to be of French origin than are younger ones.  Twenty per cent of those 80 and over are of French descent, compared to 27 per cent of those under 65. 

   Seniors make up 14 per cent of the population of villages with 1000 to 2499 people - a higher concentration than in rural areas and large urban centres. 

   Seventy-seven per cent of men 65 and over are married, compared to 41 per cent of women of the same age. 

   Thirty per cent of women in the 65-69 age group are widowed compared to 6 per cent of men.  By age 90 and over, more than 84 per cent of women are widowed, compared to 54 per cent of men. 

   Between 1961 and 1986, the proportion of women 65 and over living alone doubled from 15 per cent to 34 per cent.  The proportion of men 65 and over living alone increased from 9 per cent to 14 per cent in the same period. 

 

   In 1986 only 2 per cent of seniors between 65 and 69 lived in institutions, compared to 37 per cent of Canadians 85 and over. 

 

   Twenty-eight per cent of men aged 85 and over live in institutions, compared to 40 per cent of women of that age group. 

   3 SENIORS ARE INDEPENDENT - AND INTERDEPENDENT  

   People over 65 are too often viewed as passive and dependent.  In reality, the vast majority are as independent as adults under 65.  Maximum independence for seniors, as for younger adults, is achieved through interdependent living, that is, in mutually supportive relationships with others.   

   Most Canadians receive - and give - a great deal of social support, most of it within their network of family and friends.  Far less is provided through institutions and social services.  When aging creates special needs, seniors want to make choices about the aid required with daily activities, for example, as well as about the support they give to others.   

   A majority of seniors have the financial resources to live in their own homes.  Many seniors also give money to their children.  However, the income of seniors is concentrated at the lower end of the income scale.  

   Fifteen per cent of seniors give babysitting help to friends and family living outside their home. 

   Twenty per cent of seniors need help with grocery shopping and 4 per cent need help with personal care. 

   Eighty per cent of women and 50 per cent of men over 80 do their own housework. 

   Sixty-four per cent of seniors own their own home, most of them mortgage free. 

   Eight per cent of older Canadians live in institutions in which some custody or care is provided. 

   In 1986, 45 per cent of families with heads aged 65 and over had incomes under $20,000, compared to 18 per cent of families with heads under 65. 

   Fifty per cent of single individuals aged 65 and over had incomes under $10,000 in 1986. 

   Income support from governments, including Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement (OAS and GIS), is the single largest source of income for people aged 65 and over, providing 40 per cent of the income of older married couples and 58 per cent of the income of unattached individuals 65 and over. 

   Investment income was the second largest source of income for seniors in 1986, accounting for 19 per cent of the income of older couples. 

   Wages and salaries accounted for 21 per cent of the income of families with heads 65 and over and 3 per cent for unattached individuals 65 and over. 

    4 MOST SENIORS ARE HEALTHY   

   Aging and poor health are not synonymous.  In fact, the vast majority of seniors remain healthy enough to live independently.  Most seniors also believe they are in good health, although reported health status differs widely among those with different income and education levels.  Older people drink less, smoke less and have increased their physical fitness more than other age groups.  

   Seniors, as a group, are heavy users of health care facilities, but extended hospital stays occur only among a small proportion of older people.  However, many chronic health conditions usually associated with old age often require longer term care.  

   But the frequent occurrence of specific physiological changes does not mean that seniors are necessarily unhealthy or disabled in any significant way.  When certain activities do become difficult for seniors, changes in the physical and social environment can often compensate for any loss in functional ability.  

   Sixty-seven per cent of seniors aged 65 to 74 said their health was good or excellent.  Fifty-seven per cent of those over 75 believed the same. 

   Women over 65 report somewhat poorer health than men over 65. 

   Seventy per cent of seniors over 65 stated that life was not very or not at all stressful.  Forty-eight per cent of those under 55 said the same. 

   Fifty-six per cent of Canadians aged 65 to 74 report visiting a general practitioner three or more times in the previous year, compared to 40 per cent of those aged 45 to 54. 

   Among older Canadians who consider themselves very poor, 46 per cent say they are in very good or excellent health.  Sixty-eight per cent of seniors who are upper middle class report the same degree of health. 

   Seventy-two per cent of seniors who have completed post-secondary education report that they are in very good or excellent health, compared to 35 per cent of seniors who have an elementary education or less. 

   Nineteen per cent of Canadians over 65 smoke compared to 37 per cent of those under 55.  Eighteen per cent of seniors never drink alcoholic beverages, compared to 6 per cent of adults under 55. 

   The proportion of able-bodied seniors who exercised regularly increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent between 1976 and 1981.  Increases were considerably less in all other age groups. 

   Seniors account for 49 per cent of hospital patient days.  But a small number of seniors account for most lengthy hospital stays. 

   Fifteen per cent of individuals aged 65 to 74 reported two or more disability days in the past two weeks, compared to 12 per cent of those aged 45 to 54. 

   Two out of three Canadians over 65 say they have no long-term activity limitations.  More specifically, 9 per cent of seniors aged 65 to 74 report that their vision limits their activities and 21 per cent are restricted by their hearing ability. 

   Although 85 per cent of seniors have at least one chronic health problem, this does not affect the majority's ability to function independently. 

    5 SENIORS PARTICIPATE IN SOCIETY   

   When Canadians retire from the work force, their place in society appears completely altered.  But seniors continue to participate in numerous other social and economic activities.  They continue to earn income, spend money on goods, donate money, act as volunteers, vote in elections, use mass media and entertainment, and some are students.  

   The concept of mandatory retirement is being challenged with a view that ability, rather than chronological age, should be the basis for work force participation.  The ability to choose the time of retirement means much less disruption personally.  It also means that age 65 is becoming a much less socially significant transition.  

    Seniors' accumulation of a lifetime of experience and knowledge is far often an under-utilized resource for Canadian society.  As our society ages, older Canadians' contributions will become more important than ever.  

   Labour force participation among men aged 65 to 69 has declined from 25 per cent in 1976 to 18 per cent in 1986.  Participation for women has dropped only slightly, from 8 per cent to 7 per cent during the same period.  </I

 UNDERCURRENTS: 'so there's this guy, see...' 

   'He's at a convention in Vancouver, and he meets this woman in a bar and they sleep together.  And next morning, she kisses him goodbye and gives him an envelope and tells him not to open it until he's on the plane.  And he opens it and there's a card that says, "Welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS."  It's a true story, it happened to a friend of my brother-in-law....' 

   The story currently making the rounds could be true.  Many people who pass it on believe it.  Many of them attest to its accuracy by citing a personal connection - however remote - to the victim.  But the story is, in fact, what some folklore experts call an "urban legend."  Those analysts say that people tell such tales about extraordinary occurrences as if they are true.  As well, the legends nearly always possess a hidden twist - and, sometimes, even a kernel of truth.  Urban legends also tend to go in cycles.  Some that are circulating now appeared in slightly different forms tens, or even hundreds, of years ago.  "Different issues become prominent at different points in time," says Paul Smith, head of the folklore department at Memorial University in St. John's, Nfld.  "No one story has become prominent over time." 

   Jan Brunvand, a folklore professor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, explains in his book The Vanishing Hitchhiker that classic tales contain three essential elements: the story is basically appealing; there is some foundation in "actual belief"; and there is a message.  Said Smith: "Urban legends allow us to speak out our fears.  Some present morals with a very heavy hand.  Others are light."  What keeps them circulating, generation after generation, are the cries of delight - and the chills of horror - they inspire.  Maclean's has compiled some longtime favorites: 

  The hairy hitchhiker 

   A young woman is driving alone at night on a deserted stretch of road.  She sees a female hitchhiker - and stops.  The hitchhiker tosses a bag onto the backseat and starts to get into the front.  The driver notices that the hitchhiker's hand is large and hairy.  The driver slams the door and drives off.  Later, she opens the bag and finds a bloodstained axe. 

  The surprise party 

   A young, recently engaged couple are babysitting.  After the parents leave, the amorous couple undress.  The mother phones to say that she has forgotten to turn on the washing machine.  Still naked, the young man piggybacks his fiancee downstairs.  There, they encounter their family, friends - and the local priest - who have arranged a surprise party for them. 

  The laughing maniac 

   A teenage girl is babysitting three children, who are upstairs asleep.  She answers the phone and hears a man laughing hysterically.  She hangs up.  Fifteen minutes later, the phone rings again.  It is the same laughing man.  The babysitter phones the operator, who tells her that if he calls again, she should keep him on the line so that the operator can trace the call.  The girl does so.  The operator phones the babysitter and tells her to leave the house because the man is calling from an upstairs phone.  As the girl runs out, she sees the man coming downstairs holding a bloody butcher knife, still laughing.  She phones the police, who arrest the man and find the bodies of the three children. 

  The choking dog 

   A woman comes home and finds her dog lying on the floor, choking.  She drives the dog to a veterinarian, who says that he will call her later.  She returns home.  The vet phones and tells her to leave the house immediately - and that he has called the police.  The woman runs outside.  Later, she learns that the vet found two fingers lodged in the dog's throat.  The police find a man missing two fingers, collapsed in shock in one of the woman's closets. 

  The sneezing elephant 

   A man takes his family to a wildlife park.  The young son opens the electrically operated rear window of the station wagon and the friendly elephant sticks its trunk through it, delighting the children until it sneezes, producing a large volume of fetid gases and semi-liquids.  The terrified son closes the window on the elephant's trunk.  The enraged animal trashes the vehicle until the son releases the trunk and the family narrowly escapes. 

  The helpful wife 

   A man sees a newspaper ad for a used Porsche in excellent condition for only $50.  He rushes to the address and a woman shows him the car.  He pays the woman and asks her why the price was so low.  She explains that her husband had run off with his secretary a few days earlier and had instructed her to sell his car and send him the money. 

   Lovers' lane 

   One night, a man and woman drive to a secluded spot.  While they are embracing, a bulletin comes over the radio that a dangerous, deranged man has escaped from a nearby institution.  The man has an artificial arm.  Later, they hear a noise outside the car.  Terrified, the young man starts the car and speeds away.  When they arrive at the woman's house, they discover a bloody hook hanging one of the car's door handles. 

  Granny's vacation 

   A family on vacation is driving in Mexico with a grandmother, who dies of an apparent heart attack.  To avoid the red tape involved when a person dies in a foreign country, the family wraps her body in a blanket and ties it to the roof rack.  On the way home, they stop at a restaurant.  When they come out, the car is gone. 

  The dare 

   Two men are out canoeing on a beautiful, clear summer day.  For a joke, one man stands on the gunwales, looks up and yells, "Take me now!"  A bolt of lightning kills him. 

  The jealous husband 

   A cement-mixer operator has a job in his own neighborhood and decides to pay a surprise visit to his wife.  To his surprise, he sees an unfamiliar convertible in his driveway.  He peeks through a window and sees his wife talking to a strange man.  Assuming that she is having an affair, the husband fills up the convertible with cement.  It turns out that the man was a car dealer and the convertible was a birthday present for the husband. 

  The new pet 

   A woman vacationing in Mexico buys a Chihuahua.  She smuggles the dog across the border and, once home, takes him to her veterinarian for a checkup.  The vet tells her that the animal is a rat. 

  The turkey dinner 

   Parents leave their baby son with a new babysitter, a teenage girl who seems distracted.  The woman phones from the party and asks whether everything is all right.  The girl says yes and adds that the turkey is in the oven.  The parents rush home in time to save their son only because the girl had not turned the oven on.  She was high on LSD. 

  The underground parking lot 

   A woman leaves work late and goes to the underground parking lot.  She finds a woman in her car slumped over the steering wheel.  The woman says that she is feeling sick and asks the other woman to drive her home.  The nervous car owner excuses herself and goes to phone her husband.  He tells her not to go back to the car and says that he is going to phone the police.  They find that the woman in the car is really a man.  They also find a bloody axe under the driver's seat. 

  The vanishing child 

   A woman has taken her young son to Disneyland and, as she is standing in line to buy tickets, she briefly turns away from him.
  When she looks back, the child is gone.  She alerts security.  Twenty minutes later, a guard returns with the child, whose blond hair is now black.  The guards have caught a man coming out of a washroom with the child and found a container of dye.  </I

   DEATH DEFINED: Controversy rages over how-to suicide books 

   During the past 2 years, Marjorie Wantz, a former teacher's aide, has been tormented by pelvic pain that never stops.  From her bed in Detroit's Sinai Hospital, the 58-year-old woman said last week that she has undergone 10 operations but doctors have still not determined the cause of the pain.  Wantz, a mother of two, said that constant suffering has driven her to make two attempts to take her own life.  She also said that she has tried to follow the advice contained in Final Exit, a detailed guide on how to commit suicide published in March by the Eugene, Ore.-based Hemlock Society, which promotes legalized euthanasia.  On Aug. 18, the book reached the top of The New York Times list of best-selling advice and how-to books.  But Wantz described Final Exit as a disappointment.  She added: "It tells you to use Seconal, but you can't get it unless a doctor writes a prescription for you." 

   According to many doctors and legal experts, the popularity of Final Exit reflects a growing public preoccupation with terminal illness.  But some of the experts contend that the book's author, Derek Humphry, founder of the 42,000-member Hemlock Society, represents the radical fringe of the debate in North America about euthanasia and the rights of the terminally ill.  They say that a more accurate measure of public opinion will emerge from a Washington state plebiscite on Nov. 5.  Voters will be asked to approve or reject a proposed law that would make Washington the first American state to let doctors help terminally ill patients end their lives.  In Canada, meanwhile, two members of Parliament have introduced private members' bills dealing with euthanasia.  One would strengthen a patient's right to refuse treatment, while the second would allow terminally ill patients to take their lives after appearing before a government-appointed referee. 

   The success of Final Exit has injected new vigor into the debate over euthanasia.  The 192-page book examines in clinical detail various ways of committing suicide.  One chapter, entitled "Death Hollywood Style," describes an unreliable suicide method popularized by movies in which an individual injects air into his veins.  Another chapter, called "Bizarre Ways to Die," describes death by rattlesnake bite and by driving a car into a tree.  The book recommends neither method.  According to Humphry, the best method, because it is quick, clean and painless, is to take an overdose of barbiturates on an empty stomach and accompanied by alcohol. 

   The $23.50 book is distributed and promoted by New York City-based Carol Publishing Group.  Carol's 34-year-old publisher, Steven Schragis, a co-founder, with Toronto-born Graydon Carter, of the New York-based satirical magazine Spy, said that he was eager to help promote Final Exit because he belongs to the Hemlock Society.  Initially, Carol Publishing printed a total of 40,000 copies of the book, of which about one-half were sold by mail order through the Hemlock Society.  Humphry said that Carol sent 300 review copies to media outlets across the United States, but no reviews appeared.  Then, on July 12, The Wall Street Journal published an article about the book, and within 10 days bookstores had sold the entire first edition.  Hemlock and Carol are now printing another 125,000 copies, and Schragis said that bookstores have already placed orders for 227,000. 

   Two major Canadian bookstore chains, Cole's The Book People and W.H. Smith Classics, were both awaiting delivery of their first copies last week.  Cole's president Thomas Bryden said that he expects to have the book in most of Cole's 236 stores by early September.  Said Charlotte Caplan, a book buyer with the 180-store Smith chain: "There has been an incredible demand for it." 

   The second printing of Final Exit is likely to begin reaching bookstores just as another potentially controversial book on suicide is published.  On Sept. 2, Buffalo, N.Y.-based Prometheus Books plans to publish Dr. Jack Kevorkian's Prescription: Medicide, subtitled The Goodness of Planned Death.  Kevorkian, who lives in a Detroit suburb, is the inventor of a so-called suicide machine.  He gained international attention in June, 1990, when Janet Adkins, a 54-year-old Portland, Ore., woman who had been diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease, killed herself in a community outside Detroit while attached to his machine.  When she pressed a button, the device injected a lethal quantity of potassium chloride into one of her veins.  

   Kevorkian is a man with a mission.  He told Maclean's last week that he is determined to create a new medical specialty called obitiatry.  </I

  FAST TRACK TO FAILURE: experts study the perils of work addiction 

   During the success-oriented 1980s, the term "workaholic" was often a positive term used to describe fast-track baby boomers who earned their corporate reputations with long hours and a tireless devotion to detail.  They carried bulging briefcases, worked late and sacrificed their weekends in the hope of promotions, higher - and higher profits for their employers.  But some psychologists now say that for some people, the relentless pursuit of on-the-job perfection actually results in diminished productivity.  Indeed, some experts say that eventually, workaholics can lose their sense of control over their work and their lives.  When that occurs, the person who is addicted to work can turn moody, become prone to rages and alienate his or her family, friends and colleagues.  Said Barbara Killinger, a Toronto psychologist: "At their worst, workaholics are soulless - there's nothing inside, they have lost their integrity." 

   According to Killinger, whose book Workaholics: The Respectable Addicts was published by Key Porter Books in April, workaholics are men or women who are addicted to working and who, as a result, experience personality changes.  Yet despite the sometimes alarming consequences of the addiction, Killinger says that the problem is still widely misunderstood.  She and other experts say that an increasing number of people are seeking treatment for workaholism.  Because the addiction takes hold so slowly, Killinger said that co-workers and spouses tend to dismiss the early symptoms of workaholism - anxiety, irritability and restlessness - as the temporary side effects of overwork. 

   At the same time, Kenneth Des Roches, an Ottawa-based employment counsellor with Peat Marwick Stevenson & Kellogg, a management consulting firm, says that employers sometimes make the problem worse by assuming that someone with workaholic attributes will be a model employee.  By giving a workaholic more responsibility and prestige, says Des Roches, who regularly counsels individuals suffering from workaholism, employers can unwittingly push the workaholic too far.  Still, Des Roches says that the main problem is the obsession itself.  "People get a high from their work, and it becomes something of a vortex that they get caught up in," he said.  "Before long, they need it, and they don't want to live without it." 

   Although the word "workaholism" has been in use for only about 20 years, psychologists say that the addiction has existed for much longer.  They add that the problem has recently gained greater recognition because people in the largest segment of the North American population, those between the ages of 25 and 45, are at the stage in their careers when, according to Des Roches, workaholism "tends to get to people."  But Bart, a recovering Vancouver workaholic who at one time juggled a full-time job and a private business during 18-hour days, told Maclean's that his addiction began in his childhood.  Bart, 55, who asked that his last name be withheld, said that it was only by stopping work completely that he was able to deal with his workaholism.  "Work is a way of avoiding your feelings, like booze or drugs," he said.  "Work gives you the feeling that you're in control." 

   Killinger, who has studied workaholism for eight years, says that the classic workaholic starts off as a perfectionist who desperately needs the approval of others.  Over time, she says, working becomes a compulsion and, finally, a single-minded pursuit of self-glorification that can lead to emotional problems and personality changes.  Striving for power and control, workaholics suffer from chronic fatigue and guilt, are racked by fears and sometimes even become incapable of distinguishing right from wrong.  For her part, Susan Butt, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, says that workaholics reach the crisis stage when they begin to lose control over their lives.  When that happens to workaholics, says Butt, "they lose their sense of well-being." 

   According to Killinger, workaholics are capable of lying, cheating and, in extreme cases, violence if it serves their purposes.  Increasingly bound to their work, yet feeling out of control, they may become impatient with their children and lash out at their spouses.  "More and more," said Killinger, "I am realizing how much damage is done to the spouse." 

   According to Des Roches, companies and their employees have to recognize workaholism as a risk factor in order to prevent it from causing problems in the workplace.  "Many companies are beginning to realize that being obsessed with work is counterproductive," he said.  Individual employees, he added, must learn to work within realistic limits and not rely on work to feed their egos.  Otherwise, the successes gained from overwork can ultimately lead to painful failure. 

   Killinger says that many work addicts can be cured if they get help early.  Most important, she said, was for them to gain an understanding of their own feelings, and a realization of how their addiction has harmed their families and friends.  "In most cases, what they have left behind is a pile of broken lives," she said.  Killinger added that if workaholics can feel remorse for the damage they have done, then they can usually recover.  But, for the minority of workaholics who are unable to do that, the future is likely to turn into a fast track to failure, both on and off the job.  </I

   OBSESSED WITH SEX: self-help groups treat sexual addiction 

   The slender, intense young man, with wire-rimmed glasses and impeccably groomed hair, says that he has a solid marriage, two happy children and a rewarding job.  But, for three years, the Toronto computer technician found that he increasingly wanted to have sex with prostitutes.  After finishing his night shift at a downtown office, he said, he would drive along streets that he knew prostitutes favored.  He said that he watched them, regularly talked to them and occasionally paid for their services.  But, he said, by early last year he had become convinced that his obsession was out of control, and he began seeing a psychotherapist.  While he chose to turn to a professional for help, thousands of other North American men and women have chosen a different way of dealing with similar obsessions.  They have joined self-help groups, modelled on Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), to overcome what they regard as a damaging and potentially dangerous problem: so-called sexual addiction. 

   The self-help approach to sexual problems began to flourish during the late 1970s and, since then, three major organizations have emerged: Boston-based Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA), Minneapolis-based Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA) and California-based Sexaholics Anonymous (SA).  All of them have members in Canada, although they are reluctant to disclose details about their activities.  One of the leading proponents of the theory that sexual activity can be addictive is Patrick Carnes, a Minneapolis-based family therapist.  He operates an in-patient clinic that treats people he describes as sexually addicted individuals.  "Sex addicts do things even though it may cost them their marriage, their job and lots of money," Carnes told Maclean's.  "They use sex as a way to deal with pain." 

   Indeed, individuals who claim to be sexually addicted frequently admit that their sexual behavior is partly due to other personal problems.  A 31-year-old Minneapolis man named Bob, who has been a member of SAA for two years, said that he was a victim of incest as a child and later developed alcohol and drug problems.  The man said that he is bisexual and, before joining SAA, sometimes had daily sexual encounters.  He admitted that he visited homosexual bathhouses and massage parlors for anonymous sex, and occasionally purchased sex from prostitutes of both sexes.  Now, said Bob, "I don't go to bathhouses, massage parlors, bars or any place that might tempt me." 

   But many mental health professionals dispute the notion that sex can be addictive and warn that treatment based on the AA model should be accompanied by professional therapy.  Sidney Folb, a Toronto psychologist who has treated people with addictions and sexual problems for 20 years, said that excessive sexual activity is frequently connected to drug or alcohol abuse.  He added that he has rarely encountered anyone whose only problem is compulsive sexual behavior.  Howard Ruppel, a former sex therapist who is now executive director of the Iowa-based Society for the Scientific Study of Sex, also expressed skepticism about sexual addiction.  Said Ruppel: "It incredibly oversimplifies the issues.  I see this as a catchy, marketable tool that some people are using to encourage negative attitudes about sex." 

   But those who are involved with self-help groups dismiss the criticism of therapists and psychologists.  The manager of SAA's national office in Minneapolis, a 29-year-old man who identified himself only as Douglas, said that he joined the organization four years ago.  Before that, he said, he was obsessed by pornography and was constantly cheating on girlfriends by looking for other sexual partners.  He added: "I felt compelled to do what I was doing.  Sex addicts experience powerlessness over their sexual behavior.  Other people don't."  Douglas said that since joining SAA, he has dated eight women but became sexually involved with only one. 

   The self-help groups rely on the 12-step program first developed by AA to deal with alcoholism.  The same principles have been applied to a number of other problems, including drug addiction, compulsive gambling and overeating.  Among other things, the AA program urges participants to admit that they are powerless to control their problem.  They are advised to make an inventory of the wrongs that they have committed and the people whom they have hurt.  As well, participants are urged to accept the existence of a god, or some form of "higher power," and to try to rely on that power to help overcome their problems. 

   The major difference among the three main groups that deal with people who are excessively sexually active is in their definitions of "sexual sobriety."  Two of the groups, SAA and SLAA, attract a few homosexuals, while SA's rigid approach tends to discourage gay participation.  The most conservative, and secretive, group is SA, which was founded in 1979 and is based in Simi Valley, Calif., about 60 km north of Los Angeles.  A woman called Nan, who described herself as an executive secretary, said during a telephone interview that SA members must refrain from any type of sexual activity outside "a traditional, legal, heterosexual marriage."  She said that there are SA groups across the United States and in Canada, Europe and South America.  But she declined to disclose the number of groups or total membership. 

   A woman employee at SLAA's national office in Boston said that the organization has 850 groups, mostly in the United States and Canada.  She said that SLAA allows its members to create their own definition of sexual sobriety.  "Everybody comes into a group with different behavior that is making their life unmanageable," said the woman, who declined to give her name, "so you create your own bottom line."  A Toronto spokesman named Peter said that there are several SLAA groups in the city. 

   SAA, which has groups in Vancouver, Winnipeg and Ottawa, also allows its members to define sexual sobriety in consultation with other members.  Douglas, the manager of the national office in Minneapolis, said that SAA has 350 groups across the United States.  He added that about 80 per cent of the participants are male.  "When people get into recovery, they're generally not in great shape," said Douglas.  "They've usually suffered major consequences, such as divorce, job loss or arrest." 

   During the past six years, about 1,700 patients have checked into the 50-bed Sexual Dependency Unit at the Golden Valley Health Center near Minneapolis.  Family therapist Carnes, who is founder of the unit, said that 35-day program that he supervises involves group discussions about excessive sexual behaviour and instruction by physicians and psychotherapists on such subjects as healthy sexuality and the causes of addictive behavior.  Carnes said that full recovery from sexual addiction can take up to five years.  

   According to Carnes, self-described sex addicts often share common backgrounds and personality traits.  A book by Carnes, entitled Don't Call It Love, which will be published in March, is based on a survey of 1,000 recovering sex addicts.  Carnes said that 83 per cent of the people he surveyed had a second addiction, usually alcohol or drugs, and a similar percentage said that they had experienced sexual abuse as children.  He also found that 27 per cent of the sex addicts he talked to had been dismissed from jobs, demoted or arrested as a result of their sexual behavior.  </I<I
  Choosing judges in private 

   By his own admission, Willard Estey was a compromise choice for the Supreme Court of Canada.  "They happened to need a guy from Ontario and they couldn't agree on who," recalled Estey of his 1977 appointment to the Supreme Court bench just nine months after becoming Ontario's chief justice.  The deadlock was resolved, said Estey, who at the time was reluctant to leave the Ontario court, by "grabbing the Ontario chief justice."  Now retired from the Supreme Court and practising law in Toronto, the highly regarded former judge added: "I got moved into that job the same way I was moved around by the Air Force during the war."  And Estey, like all other justices of Canada's top court, began his new job without being subjected to the public examination that U.S. Supreme Court nominees have to undergo according to the American Constitution. 

   Canadian Supreme Court judges are named by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister.  The only fixed requirements are that at least three of the judges must be members of the Quebec bar, and that any appointee must have been a member of a Canadian bar for at least 10 years.  As well, all federal judges have been screened since 1967 by the Canadian Bar Association and, since 1988, by a five-member advisory committee made up of federal and provincial legal authorities that privately assesses candidates. 

   In practice, the power to shape the composition of the Supreme Court has rested with the prime minister, who is under no legal obligation to follow the advisory committee's recommendations.  Since Prime Minister Brian Mulroney took office in 1984, he has appointed eight of the nine current justices, and some Canadians have complained that the present appointment process could allow a prime minister to stack the court with political friends.  As a result, some critics of the system have urged the introduction of a public review process for prospective justices.  Said Frederick Vaughan, a political science professor at Ontario's University of Guelph: "With the introduction of the charter of rights in 1982, these people exercise extraordinary power.  They should undergo some measure of public scrutiny by our legislators. " 

   But other experts contend that such a process would merely graft another element of the U.S. political system onto Canada's parliamentary form of government.  And even those calling for changes to the system, including Vaughan, acknowledge that all Supreme Court justices since the 1960s have been well qualified.  "The legal community does a very good job of regulating itself and weeding out bad lawyers," said Vaughan.  But as the influence of the Supreme Court grows, calls for an open review of new judges may increase.

  THE WAR OF THE SEXES: new calls for rules on sexual harassment 

   The 44-year-old black woman, who took her complaint to Ontario's Workers' Compensation Board, said that she was constantly harassed during a six-year period in the 1980s by male co-workers at the Colgate-Palmolive Canada soap factory in the Toronto area.  The woman, whose name was not made public, worked on a packing line and said that men there would frequently leave obscene drawings in her locker, make racist and sexist remarks and, in one incident, gave her a piece of soap carved in the form of a penis.  Despite a complaint to her union and to the company's management, the woman said that she received little support and eventually suffered a nervous breakdown.  In June, 1990, in a precedent-setting decision, the Workers' Compensation Board hearings officer ordered the company to pay an as-yet-undetermined amount for illnesses that stemmed from the stress of enduring sexual harassment on the job.  Colgate officials vowed to fight the award, but late last month withdrew their appeal.  The landmark case opened up another avenue complaint for victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.  Still, many experts say that it remains widespread in Canadian society - and often is not dealt with seriously enough. 

   The dramatic confrontation this month between University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill and her former employer, U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, focused new attention on the issue.  After Hill testified before the Senate judiciary committee in Washington that Thomas harassed her by repeatedly asking for dates, boasting of his sexual prowess and describing pornographic movies, the Senate last week ratified Thomas's appointment to the court by a vote of 52 to 48. 

   For its part, the Supreme Court of Canada, in deciding a case in 1989, defined sexual harassment as "unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of the harassment."  According to studies carried out in the United States and Canada, sexual harassment in the workplace affects an estimated 80 to 90 per cent of women at some point in their lives.  (Only a small number of men ever complain of sexual harassment.)  In 1990, federal and provincial human rights commissions received hundreds of complaints of sexual harassment in the workplace.  Said Maxwell Yalden, chief commissioner of the federal human rights commission: "It is a problem that is very much present and very much felt by women across the country."  He added: "Whatever the numbers are, it's a shattering experience for the individual." 

   Telling jokes, putting an arm around a co-worker or asking a colleague for a date is not, according to experts in the field, unacceptable behavior in the right context.  But they concede that what does constitute sexual harassment in the workplace is difficult for some people to grasp.  Experts say that the offending behavior typically takes one of two forms.  The first occurs when there is an implied or explicit link between requested sexual favors and a promotion or job security.  The second form of harassment occurs when a person - particularly a superior - subjects an employee to unwelcome attentions that create a poisoned, uncomfortable or hostile working environment.  "It is much more subtle than most people think," said lawyer and criminologist Judith Osborne, harassment policy co-ordinator at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C.  "It's not always the blatant touching, feeling or making sexual requests.  It's often wrapped up as a joke - often not a very funny joke."  Osborne added: "In many workplaces, those kinds of off-color conversations - the sort of dissecting of people's sex lives - is seen as being the regular Monday-morning conversation." 

   Many experts say that the reason sexual harassment has become more of an issue in recent years is the increasing number of women in the workforce.  The resulting change in rules for workplace behavior, they add, has confused many men.  "Men say, 'Anyone could accuse me of sexual harassment and I didn't mean to do it at all,' " said Nancy Adamson, co-ordinator for the status of women and a sexual-harassment adviser at Carleton University in Ottawa.  "I say, think about whether you would like someone to do this to your mother, your daughter, your wife.  And if you feel uneasy at all about the behavior, stop it."  Adamson and others concede that it is difficult to make people fully understand the seriousness of sexual harassment.  Added Adamson: "There's no reverse situation.  You can't say to men, 'Imagine if a woman were doing this to you.'  It's not the same thing. " 

   Still, some critics maintain that existing definitions of sexual harassment are too vague and can have the effect of trapping innocent people.  "When is a look a leer?" said Howard Levitt, a Toronto lawyer who specializes in wrongful-dismissal suits.  "When is an invitation to dinner a come-on?"  Levitt also claims that the potential exists for people to frivolously accuse someone of sexual harassment.  Explained Levitt: "The very fact of the allegation is so destructive to their career that the person who is being accused is likely to pay a tremendous amount of money to keep the accuser quiet." 

   The effects of genuine sexual harassment on a victim can be devastating according to experts.  "It has a real, sinister, debilitating kind of effect on one's self-esteem," said Debi Forsyth-Smith, president of the Halifax-based Nova Scotia Advisory Council on the Status of Women.  "People say, 'Why is this happening to me?'  And sexual harassment generally happens in isolation, behind a closed door when nobody else is around."  As well, victims are often harassed by superiors.  Said Adamson: "When you are in a position of power and you start touching or making sexual jokes or innuendoes, those under you have to think about their position before they challenge your behavior." 

   Following through with a formal complaint in Canada can be a daunting and lengthy process for sexual-harassment victims.  According to Yalden, the victim will usually file a complaint with the federal or provincial human rights commission against both the alleged harasser and the employer (under Canadian law, employers have a responsibility for a harassment-free workplace).  If officials believe that there are grounds for the complainant's case, they will begin gathering evidence. 

   Throughout the process, Yalden explained, the commission will make every attempt to arrive at an informal settlement between the parties.  If none can be reached, the commission will, if warranted, appoint a conciliator to try to find a settlement.  Failing that, a tribunal can be established to hear testimony in public.  Finally, the board reaches a conclusion and issues an order, which could involve the awarding of financial damages, the reinstatement of a job or the granting of a promotion that was previously denied as a result of the complainant's refusal to comply with the harasser's demands.  The employer and the individual charged with harassment could then appeal the commission's decision before the courts.  In some cases, the process can take years before all the appeals have been heard and a final ruling has been rendered. 

   Some experts maintain that victims of sexual harassment in the workplace are not served well under the current system.  Because sexual harassment is not a criminal offence, a complainant has no recourse but to go to a human rights commission.  In most provinces, commissions have large backlogs of cases.  Another problem, according to Levitt, is that the commissions tend to "give notoriously puny awards for anything other than proof of economic loss."  Financial damages typically range from $250 to $3,000.  Indeed, the consequences of filing a complaint may outweigh the benefits.  Complainants, said Levitt, "have to go to the human rights commission, make a complaint, prove they're harassed, wait a number of years and, even if they win, it might be difficult to get a job somewhere else because they're seen as shit-disturbers."  But ultimately, experts agree, most victims of sexual harassment are really only seeking one thing: for the offensive behavior to stop.

  BLACKENED BLUE: scandal strikes the Edmonton police force 

   Edmonton Police Chief Douglas McNally seemed shaken last week when he appeared in public at his headquarters.  Just 3 hours earlier, Edmonton detectives had arrested one of their own, Const. Roy Gordon Lawrence, 33, in a car a few blocks from his home in St. Albert, a suburb of the Alberta capital.  Charged with kidnapping and sexually assaulting two eight-year-old boys and a 10-year-old girl, Lawrence was immediately suspended without pay from his beat at the West Edmonton Mall shopping centre.  McNally, who said that he and the Edmonton police force were embarrassed by the case, declared that the matter was an "isolated incident" and insisted that the vast majority of his officers possessed "high moral standards."  But some Edmontonians expressed concern.  "You teach your kids that the police are their friends and you go to them when you are in trouble," said Guy L'Heureux, 38, an Edmonton housepainter.  "Then something like this happens." 

   Lawrence's arrest followed several recent scandals that McNally acknowledged had shaken public confidence in the Edmonton force.  Twice during the past two months, city policemen have been charged with drinking-and-driving-related offences.  And in June, Const. Jens Goldgrabe, 30, was sentenced to six years in prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting a suspected shoplifter.  Goldgrabe, whom McNally called "a disgrace to the uniform," had forced the handcuffed woman to perform oral sex on him and call him "master."  In another incident the previous month, a judge authorized private charges of assault and torture against three police officers who allegedly roughed up a 32-year-old man on the steps of a courthouse in May, 1990. 

   Other scandals have also hit the Edmonton police force in recent years.  In 1989, Const. Jerry Donovan, 34, who had been charged with the sexual assault of a female officer in 1988, shot and killed his wife, Const. Shannon Donovan, 28, before fatally shooting himself.  In the same year, Hans Bredeman, 40, a 17-year veteran of the department, was sentenced to 15 years in prison after being convicted of devising a plan that resulted in his mistress shooting and injuring his wife, Faye.

          Chapter Three: The Treaty and the
Constitution      
    Three assumptions about parliamentary democracy in New
Zealand were taken for granted in the previous chapter.
  The first is that the will of the majority, as
demonstrated in Parliamentary elections, prevails.   The
second is that the will of the majority is equated for
electoral purposes with the number of candidates who win the
most votes in each electorate.   Ours is a first past the
post form of representation, not one based on proportional
representation.   The third is that Parliaments do not bind
their successors.   Each Parliament is sovereign&semi; laws
passed during the life of one Parliament can be reconsidered
in the future by another.  
    These assumptions have been the focus of much public
debate during the fourth Labour Government.   In many
respects that debate reflects similar debates in most other
democracies during the eighties.   The growth of executive
power is an international phenomenon and the continuing
question is how to find constitutional ways of curbing it.
  But as countries differ in their constitutional and
political arrangements so, too, do they differ in the specific
issues that are the focus of particular concern.   One of
the things that distinguishes the New Zealand debate is
the recognition to be given to the Treaty of Waitangi in any
changes in our formal constitution.   This, as we shall see,
was an issue of central importance in the deliberations of the
recent Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and in the White
Paper on a Bill of Rights for New Zealand.  
          The Crown in New
Zealand        
    The question that prompted all attempts at
constitutional reform in the 1980s was: How should the Crown
exercise its powers of sovereignty?   The words sovereign
and sovereignty express power and supremacy.   They are used
without limiting qualifications.   To have sovereignty is to
have the authority to make decisions and the power to carry
them out.  
    The Crown is one way of expressing sovereignty.   In
its figurative meaning, Crown is a king or queen, regal power,
the supreme governing power in a monarchy.   In the course
of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, British monarchs
gradually lost their personal right to sovereign power.
  The power of the Crown came to be exercised by ministers,
who made executive decisions in the name of the Crown, and by
Parliament, which legislated in the name of the Crown.
  Laws, once made, were administered not by the monarch but
by the courts in the interests of justice that was impartial
and fair to all citizens.  
    It was as the official agent of a ruling monarch that
Captain Hobson treated for the sovereignty of New Zealand.
  The Treaty of Waitangi joined New Zealand to the British
Empire in 1840 and our constitutional and political evolution
since then has been within the British tradition of
constitutional monarchy.   Under the Constitution Act 1986,
Queen Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand.   All acts
of sovereignty affecting the lives of New Zealanders are made
under her symbolic authority.   In fact, they are made by
men and women who, through election or appointment, draw their
authority from the New Zealand Government.   But they
exercise that authority for the Crown in New Zealand.  
    The Crown in New Zealand - and in many other nations
of the Commonwealth - expresses a particular form of
constitutional monarchy.   New Zealanders of British lineage
can look back on an unbroken evolution of our constitutional,
legal and political institutions, and see them as the
continuing expression of a political democracy.   This gives
them great legitimacy in the minds of most New Zealanders, who
know that governments rule only for as long as they win enough
votes to stay in power.   Indeed, the concept of majority
rule is seen by many as the essential, defining feature of our
democracy.   Our notions of equality are commonly expressed
in terms of what a majority says or wants to happen.
  Usually, they focus on political matters - on the policies
and decisions of the government of the day and whether these
are thought to be in the best interests of the country as a
whole.  
    This is also a community in which the rule of law is a
basic value.   New Zealanders take it to be an essential
feature of a truly democratic society that no one is above the
law and no one should be given special privileges under it.
  Legal equality and political equality stem from the same
set of moral beliefs.   But equality is a slippery word.
  Equality before the law does not mean that distinctions
cannot be made in the circumstances of those whose rights are
to be judged in the courts.   It means that people in like
circumstances should be treated alike.  
    But who is to decide what, in any sphere of public
life, 'like circumstances' are to mean?   In New Zealand
that power is entrusted to a parliament which sits as a single
chamber made up of the elected representatives of the people.
  The powers of our national parliament are not restricted
as they are in federal systems such as Australia or Canada.
  There is no second chamber and, with it, the possibility
that another body of men and women may be responsive to points
of view that may not be represented in the House of
Representatives.   The constitution does not entrench rights
which can be tested in the courts against legislation passed
by Parliament.   New Zealand 's uncomplicated form of unitary
government is as pure an example of majority rule as can be
found in any parliamentary democracy.  
    The absence of restraints has not until recent decades
been thought to be a serious deficiency, so great has been the
equation of democracy and majority rule.   Indeed, the long
demise of the Legislative Council and its final abolition were
consequences of an enduring public opinion that a House of
nominated members should not be allowed to frustrate the
wishes of a majority of elected representatives.   The
Legislative Council had lost the power to delay legislation or
to be obstructive well before it was abolished in 1950.  
    That decision settled one political issue, only to
raise another.   A parliamentary democracy whose
sovereign power is vested in a single legislature of elected
representatives is not, without other safeguards, an obvious
champion of the freedoms of individuals or the rights of
minorities.   On the contrary, it is an expression of
majority power.  
    In the nineteenth century conception of the
Westminster system of parliamentary democracy, Parliament,
through its two houses, curbed the powers of the executive
government.   It retained an independent capacity to make
and amend the law, vote money, and impose taxes.   But in
its twentieth century practice, here and elsewhere in the
Commonwealth, the executive, through processes of party
discipline, dominates the legislature.   New Zealand, with a
single chamber through which the political will of the
majority party can be translated into law, experiences that
domination in an extreme form.  
    All democratic communities now face the problem of
curbing the executive.   Governments have become more and
more powerful and pervasive in the lives of the people.
  But societies have become more and more diverse in their
composition.   The international concern about human rights
is not directed only at totalitarian regimes.   In
democracies, too, questions are raised wherever there are
minorities whose interests cannot in all circumstances be
assured of protection by elected representatives drawn
predominantly, from the majority culture.  
    In New Zealand, answers to these questions are being
sought on four main fronts.   First, there is electoral
reform, which seeks, by changing the rules by which
parliamentarians are elected, to achieve a more accurate
reflection of the range of political opinion in the community.
  Second, there are reforms of Parliament itself, to ensure
that legislators are as open as possible to expressions of
public opinion when they are considering changes in the law.
  Third, there is the possibility of entrenching certain
rights and freedoms of citizens through a Bill of Rights which
would protect them against the possible exercise of
legislative power by a Parliamentary majority.   Fourth,
there is the devolution of the powers of central government on
to bodies which are expected to make their own decisions but
with proper public accountability.  
    Discussion of these important issues will be confined
here to treaty matters and to their implications for the
rights of Maori as tangata whenua.   Public debate has so
far resulted in no change in the electoral system and a
rejection of any transfer of power from Parliament to the
courts.   It is through parliamentary reform and
devolution of the powers of central government that practical
steps are being taken to curb the power of the executive.
  Parliamentary reform is discussed in this chapter, and
changes in the structures and processes of government in
chapter four.  
          Effective Maori
representation        
    All discussion of the sovereignty of the Crown in our
parliamentary democracy ends in paradox.   In the
constitutional formulations, the flow of power and authority
is from sovereign to subject, from the Crown high up to the
people beneath.   But the legitimacy of the Crown in New
Zealand derives from the votes of its adult citizens.
  Ruling parties must face the electors at least once every
three years.   Does, then, sovereignty rest ultimately with
the voting public?   And if it does, do our electoral
arrangements ensure that the diversity of views held by the
voting public are fairly represented in Parliament?   More
particularly, are the views and interests of Maori New
Zealanders represented fairly?    
    These questions were among the matters investigated by
the Royal Commission on the Electoral System, whose
report, 'Towards a Better Democracy' was published in December
1986.    1       The report was notable in at
least two respects.   First, it identified principles in the
light of which electoral systems should be judged for their
fairness and effectiveness.   Its analysis of our system and
its proposals for reform stemmed from those principles.
  Second, it applied these same principles to Maori
representation, and the conclusions it reached were as
important in shaping its recommendations as the ones that
emerged from its general analysis.   At all stages its
concern was to propose an electoral system that would fully
acknowledge the treaty rights of Maori as tangata whenua and
enable their expression in ways common to all New Zealanders.
  What it had to say about Maori representation highlighted
two ideals that are most difficult to achieve in any electoral
system: the effective representation of minority and special
interest groups and, at the same time, the experience of
political integration where different groups respect each
  others'   points of view but also have regard to the
good of the community as a whole.  
    Ours is an uncomplicated electoral system.
  Electors have one vote and they confer it on a candidate
who seeks to represent their electoral district.   Each
electorate is represented by one member and the candidate with
the most votes wins each seat.   The party with the largest
number of elected candidates wins the election and forms the
government.   There are ninety-three general seats and four
Maori seats.  
    It is popularly believed that this system allows the
wishes of the majority to prevail, but it seldom does.
  Only four of the seventeen governments elected since 1935
won more than 50 percent of all the votes cast.   All
governments since 1954 have been  'majority' governments
elected with less than 50 percent of the total vote.   In
two elections, 1978 and 1981, the party with the most votes
did not win the election.   The disparity between votes cast
and seats won is much greater for minor parties.   In 1981,
for example, Social Credit polled 20.5 percent of all votes
and won two seats.   In 1984 the New Zealand Party polled
12.3 percent of all votes and no seats.  
    The Royal Commission concluded that this system is
inherently deficient.     'The critical question
now,'   it said,   'is about the fairness and
equality of the ways in which the votes of New Zealanders, at
the national rather than the constituency level, are turned
into representation in
Parliament.'      2       It also
concluded that some form of proportional representation
offers the best answer.   It discussed various forms and
recommended the Mixed Member Proportional System (MMP).
  This, it believed,   'would be fairer to supporters
of significant political parties and likely to provide more
effective representation of Maori and other minority and
special interest groups.'      3    
  The result, it argued,  would be a more effective
Parliament.  
    Under MMP each voter would have two votes.   One
would go to constituency candidates who would stand in
sixty electoral districts.   The other would be for a party
list of candidates for sixty national seats.   The number of
seats each party won from the national list would be in
proportion to its percentage of the total vote.   That would
eliminate the present disparity between the number of votes
cast for a party and the number of seats it held in the House.
  There would be one general proviso: only parties with at
least one successful candidate or 4 percent of all list
votes would be eligible for list seats.   That would prevent
political fragmentation.   There would be no separate Maori
seats and no Maori roll.   Community interest among tribal
groups would, however, be taken into account when constituency
boundaries were drawn up.   And the 4 percent threshold for
list votes would not apply to parties primarily
representing Maori interests.  
    In the submissions to the Royal Commission there was a
clear difference of opinion about the desirability of separate
Maori representation.   The vast majority of non-Maori
submissions argued against it.   Most held it to be in
conflict with the principle of equality.   With one
exception, all Maori submissions wanted to keep it.
  They left the Royal Commission in no doubt about its
symbolic importance.   The four seats, it wrote, have
  'come to be regarded by Maori as an important
concession to and the principle expression of, their
constitutional position under the Treaty of
Waitangi'  .    4      
    The Royal Commission emphasised that, whatever changes
were made, Maori interests should be represented by MPs who
were also members of the Maori community.   That, however,
was a necessary but not a sufficient means of achieving their
effective representation.   As the report put it:
        In a democratic system, the
protection of minority interests ought to be the
responsibility of Parliament as a whole and not just of the
MPs who happen to belong to the minority group.   All MPs
ought to be accountable in some degree to Maori electors.
  Support of the majority of Maori interests is more likely
to be forthcoming if all Maori electors have an effective vote
- one which carries some weight in the election of
political parties to Government, and hence one for which
parties will need to compete.   An effective Maori vote
would have an important bearing upon the ways in which Maori
concerns are regarded both by the individual representatives
and by the political
parties.        5        
    The Royal Commission criticised the present form of
Maori representation because it ensures that the
representatives of the two communities, Maori and Pakeha, are
ultimately responsible only to the constituencies that elected
them.   The problems that this poses for Maori MPs are in
principle the problems of any small minority: how to get the
dominant majority to respect their rights and attend to their
interests.   What is less well understood is that separate
representation does not give the majority any political
incentive to take Maori seriously.   That leaves members of
the Maori community powerless unless, through electoral means,
they can use their votes to make parties and governments
attentive to their concerns.   Separate representation
coupled with minority status has ensured the
  'political dependency of the Maori people and their
exposure to non-Maori control over their destiny and
future.'      6      
    The report argued that the MMP system based on a
common electoral roll is the best way to achieve the effective
representation of Maori interests.   Maori and part-Maori
electors make up about 10 percent of all voters.   Their
vote for national party lists would give all political parties
something to compete for.   It would offer   'Maori
considerable scope for developing their potential voting
strength and for charting their own political
future.'      7      
    The Royal Commission emphasised that changes in the
electoral system are only part of what is needed to give
adequate protection to Maori rights in our constitutional and
political system.   Five other steps also need to be taken.
  First, Maori should have greater control over their own
affairs as iwi and hapu.   Second, there should be greater
statutory protection for Maori rights recognised in the
treaty.   Third, there should be an independent statutory
body to deal with complaints that those rights were not being
honoured.   That requirement was being addressed through
the Waitangi Tribunal.   Fourth, the treaty might be given
the status of supreme law as proposed in the draft Bill of
Rights which was also the subject of public discussion while
the Royal Commission was at work.   Fifth,   'the
constitutional position of the Maori people might be more
formally recognised in our legislative processes and
institutions.'     It therefore recommended that
  'Parliament and Government enter into consultation and
discussion with a wide range of representatives of the Maori
people about the definition and protection of the rights of
the Maori people and the recognition of their
constitutional position under the Treaty of
Waitangi.'      8      
  box  
    After its publication, the Royal Commission 's report
was referred to the parliamentary Electoral Law Committee,
which considered a large number of public submissions on it.
  The Labour and National parties had not in the past been
impressed with the merits of proportional representation.
  Neither the arguments of the Royal Commission nor the
opinions expressed in response to it changed their
positions.  
    The select committee acknowledged that the present
system is unfair to minority parties and special interest
groups.   But it concluded that   'proportional
representation would achieve fairness to the voting public at
the expense of single-party government - and that it opposed.
    Its studies suggested that in none of the elections of
the last thirty years would any one party have been able to
form its own government if MMP had been used.   New Zealand
would have had coalition or minority governments and the
choice of Government would not have been made by the voter but
would have been made indirectly by the representatives of the
various parties in the House.  '     The experience
of some other countries is that the party with the highest
percentage of the vote can find itself in opposition to a
coalition led by another major party it has  'defeated' in the
poll.   (This happened following the Norwegian general
election in 1989.)   Coalition government, the committee
felt,   'can never be truly accountable to the
electorate as the voter is not really sure whom to blame for
the implementation of bad policies or legislation.'  
  It was therefore   'firmly of the opinion that the
election of the government is one of the strongest arguments
supporting the retention of the present
system.'      9      
    On the subject of Maori representation, submissions to
the committee remained polarised.   Maori leaders were
obviously not persuaded that their rights would be protected
better under MMP.   With one exception, they wanted the
present system to be retained, and they also wanted the number
of Maori seats to reflect more accurately the number of Maori
who opt for the Maori roll.   The Government members of the
committee recommended that separate Maori seats should be
retained, with a statutory minimum of four seats.   They
also recommended changes in the rules for estimating the
number and size of Maori electorates.  
    The Electoral Law Committee reported back in December
1988.   It recommended, and the House agreed, that the
present voting system should continue.   The Labour
majority also recommended, however, that questions about a
limited form of proportional representation and the length of
the term of Parliament be submitted to an indicative
referendum.   David Lange had given an undertaking in August
1987 that a Labour Government would hold a referendum on
proportional representation.   In October 1987 the
Government announced its agreement in principle to hold one,
but in April 1989, after debate within the Labour Party,
decided against it.   Then, in March 1990, the Opposition
took up the larger issue of Parliamentary reform in response
to the speed with which the Government had put through
legislation for the sale of Telecom, and to the late addition
to a Bill that required private broadcasters to make
broadcasting time available to political parties during
election campaigns.     'We have no second
chamber'  , Hon. Jim Bolger argued,   'no written
constitution or bill of rights, and our Parliament is elected
on a first past the post
basis.'      10       The National Party
is preparing a policy statement on political reform which is
expected to include proposals for proportional representation
and a second chamber.   John Terris M.P. and Jim Anderton
M.P. proposed private member 's bills on proportional
representation for consideration during the 1990 session of
Parliament, and John Terris 's Bill was given a first reading
in May.   The Government reconsidered its position, and the
Prime Minister announced that it would introduce legislation
this year to hold a referendum at the same time as the 1992
local body elections.   Mr Bolger has said that a National
government would hold a referendum before 1993.
  Proportional representation is on the political
agenda.  
    The value of the public discussion initiated by the
Royal Commission 's report is that it has changed the context
within which arguments about our electoral arrangements are
now conducted.   People are becoming more aware of the
differences of opinion, interest and allegiance that are to be
found in the voting community.   They are also coming to
value, or at least accept, expressions of minority opinion
that may not be compatible with the views of one or other of
the two main parties.   MMP may not be the answer, but the
pressure for proportional representation in some form seems
likely to increase as time goes on.  
    One of the important gains is the attention that has
been given not only to Maori electoral rights but also to
their constitutional and political rights.   Where, in the
past, Maori representation had been seen as something of
concern only to Maoridom, the Royal Commission 's report
underlined its significance for all New Zealanders.
  Central to its report was its understanding of what the
Treaty of Waitangi signified.   To the Royal Commission
  'it marked the beginning of constitutional government
in New Zealand.'      11       The
Electoral Law Committee agreed that this opens up very large
issues about the expression of Maori interests and the
recognition of Maori rights in our constitutional and
political systems.   It therefore supported the Royal
Commission 's recommendation that   'the issues of
the definition and protection of Maori rights and their
constitutional position under the Treaty of Waitangi needed to
be addressed in a comprehensive and systematic
way.'     It   'envisaged that there should be a
constitutional partnership between the Crown and the Maori
people.'      12      
      These are the responses of Parliamentarians who
recognise that our present constitutional arrangements are not
as responsive to Maori interests and concerns as they
should be.   Changes are called for, but it is not clear
what these should be or how they might take place.   The
first task is therefore for members of the two institutions
that exercise the sovereignty of the Crown - Parliament
and the Government - to open up a dialogue with Maori
leaders.      

  

          What Did the Shark Say to the
Kahawai?      
        Metaphors of Culture Within Ethnic Relations
Discourse in New Zealand      
      Jeffrey Sissons  
    Department of Anthropology  
    University of Otago    
        Introduction      
    Some years ago, a colleague suggested that it might be
useful to think of culture as a fruit cake - an edible
'gestalt', greater, when baked, than the sum of its parts (or
ingredients).   Cultural rules could be likened, it was
suggested, to a recipe that was carefully followed or
partially improvised.   Most sociologists and
anthropologists would probably find this metaphor somewhat
idiosyncratic, yet it is hardly more colourful than many of
the more conventional images routinely employed in academic
and more popular discussions of Maori-Pakeha relations in New
Zealand.   The process of cultural assimilation, for
example, is often described in terms of a digestive metaphor:
      When Pakehas tell us we ought
to assimilate... it is like a shark saying 'let  '  s
assimilate' to a kahawai and then opening his mouth and
swallowing him for breakfast   (Metge,
1976:305).    
    Many writers in the field of ethnic relations write,
and presumably 'think', about culture as if it had objective
properties, even when they explicitly acknowledge that
'culture' is an abstract analytical concept.   In other
words, they reify culture in culturally conventional ways.  
    The inspiration for this paper arose while I was
reviewing the reports and minutes of a governmental Maori
advisory group.   This group was officially designated a
'cultural' advisory body and     it 's    its    
name reflected     it 's    its     primary
emphasis upon combating the lack of understanding of, and
sensitivity towards, Maori culture in one corner of the state
bureaucracy.   While reading through the official documents,
I noticed that on a number of occasions, culture was likened
to a spiritual essence or 'wairua'.   As recorded in the
minutes of one meeting, held in 1988, a central objective was
to ensure that Maori culture should   'flow'  
through the staff of the institution.   At a later meeting,
it was agreed that there was an urgent need to   'instil
wairua into the system'  .   Since the work of Sapir
and Crocker (1977), Ortney (1979), Lakoff and Johnson (1980),
Salmond (1982) and Parkin (1984), the political significance
of metaphor in directing our thought and action has become
widely acknowledged.   Because metaphors predispose us to
understand problems in certain conventional (and
unconventional) ways, they also encourage us to favour certain
 'solutions'.   If culture is assumed to be a spiritual
essence or force which, like the Holy Spirit (Wairua Tapu in
Maori), might flow through a collectivity, then the solution
to the problem of institutional discrimination and
monoculturalism takes on a religious or missionary aspect.
  People need to be encouraged to open their 'hearts and
minds' to Maori culture by those who can show them the way.
  Cultural  'missionaries' are required to teach the cultural
message and so break down the prejudice which blocks the
'flow' of culture throughout the system.  
    Alerted to the fact that these idealist reifications
of culture were influencing efforts to counter ethnic
inequality and negative discrimination within one
state-bureaucratic arena, I began to wonder what other
reifications might be active within the wider field of ethnic
politics in New Zealand.   In this article, I propose to
identify and discuss some of these more conventional
metaphors.   I begin with a review of some recent critiques
of the 'ethnicity as culture' approach to ethnic relations in
New Zealand and seek to clarify its ideological grounding.
  I then go on to identify some of the key reifications of
culture within New Zealand 's ethnic relations discourse over
the last fifteen years or so, and show how these naturalise
and 'fix' idealist understandings of Maori-Pakeha relations,
thus reproducing the ideological grounding of the 'ethnicity
as culture' approach.   I conclude by suggesting that this
analysis might be extended into a critique of biculturalism
and multiculturalism as ideology.      
        The Ethnicisation of Culture    
    Over the past few years, the value of culturalist
understandings of ethnicity and ethnic politics in New Zealand
has been increasingly questioned by sociologists,
anthropologists and educationalists.   In general, two main
criticisms have been directed at this 'ethnicity as culture'
approach: firstly, it is excessively idealist, and secondly,
it mistakenly equates ethnic boundaries with cultural ones.
  In what follows, I briefly review each of these
criticisms.  
    One of the earliest critiques of idealist analyses of
ethnicity in New Zealand was Miles and Spoonley 's (1985)
article in the   Australian and New Zealand Journal of
Sociology.     Directing their Althusserian-inspired
attack specifically at Pearson (1983) and Pitt and Macpherson
(1974), they argued against privileging the
  'consciousness of cultural origins'   over
  'the differential distribution of agents to various
sites in class relations'   (Miles and Spoonley,
1985:21-22).   These authors proposed instead that ethnicity
be approached through a study of the political economy of
labour migration.   More recently, Spoonley has reiterated
his claim that to analyse ethnic relations in terms of
cultural difference is to remain at an ideological level:
        One of the problems with an
analysis of 'ethnicity as culture' is that it abstracts the
practise of ethnicity from its economic and political context
and leaves any analysis open to charges of being idealist.
  Ethnicity as a form of economic and political mobilisation
assumes that... ideological relations and effects (i.e. those
associated with ethnicity)... intersect with class and gender
relations as part of the complex relations of
capitalism   (Spoonley, 1991:156).      
    Pearson, while not accepting that Miles and Spoonley 's
Marxist approach is   a priori   any less ideological
than his own Weberian position (Pearson, 1985: 272-273),
agrees with Spoonley on the need to go beyond culture and
examine the material foundations of ethnicity:
        One does not have to be a
Marxist to acknowledge that much recent debate about ethnicity
in New Zealand is so enraptured by ideas and identities that
it forgets to examine the material conditions which influence
their formation   (Pearson,
1990:239).      
    If one assumes that culture is primarily an
ideological system or a    'system of symbols and
meanings in terms of which a particular group of people make
sense of their world'   (Metge, 1976:45), then the above
criticisms by Spoonley and Pearson are undoubtedly
well-directed.   If, on the other hand, culture is conceived
of as a total   'way of life'   (James and
Saville-Smith, 1989:13),   'the total lifestyle of a
people... all of the ideas, knowledge, behaviour and material
objects they share'   (Sullivan and Thompson, 1984:35),
or an anthropological equivalent to the sociological concept
of  'society' (Nash, 1990:99), then the critical edge of these
    authors      authors'       comments is
blunted.   They leave open the possibility for advocates of
the 'ethnicity as culture' approach to stretch their
essentially idealist concept of culture to accommodate
materialist critiques.  
    A more powerful line of attack is to observe that the
'ethnicity as culture' approach mistakenly equates ethnic
boundaries with cultural ones.   This second line of
argument has also been advanced by Pearson and Spoonley, and
it has been less directly pursued by Nash.   Pearson has
noted that the discussion of biculturalism and
multiculturalism in New Zealand has been
  'bedeviled'   by misconceptions concerning the
terms 'race', 'culture', 'ethnicity',  'state' and 'nation'.
  With reference to the 'culture-ethnicity' distinction, he
points out that:
        Ethnicity is not culture
  per se  .   The notion of 'two [main] cultures' in
New Zealand is just as meaningless as 'two races'.   However
we define 'culture', and the word is as contested or taken for
granted among anthropologists as  'society' is within
sociology, it has much wider boundaries than ethnicity  
(Pearson, 1991:196).      
    Spoonley agrees:
        ...ethnicity is not the same
as culture.   All of us 'have culture' [or live culture] but
ethnicity concerns social networks which rely on an explicit
consciousness of difference...   [Ethnicity] can exist as an
alternative to other forms of political consciousness and
political activity, such as class, or it can reinforce
them   (Spoonley, 1991:156).      
    For Nash, also, New Zealand cannot be said to comprise
two distinct ethnic cultures, Maori and Pakeha (Nash 1990:
99-100).   Rather, New Zealand is a highly integrated
society within which a   'Maori cultural system'  
is   'embedded'  .   While this Maori
   'socio-system'   constitutes a   'partial
society'  , he argues that there is no equivalent
  'Pakeha society'   at the systemic level.
  Nash is critical of the way biculturalist discourse
directs attention   'towards the analysis of Maori
culture and Pakeha culture and, what is more, to culture
conceived as a reified idealist abstraction'   (Nash,
1990:99).  
    In concurring with these writers on the need to
radically dis-articulate culture and ethnicity, I would like
to go further and suggest that while it makes analytical sense
to talk of culture in the singular, it does not make sense to
then reify this concept and talk of cultures (plural) as if
they were empirical phenomena whose boundaries might be
somehow empirically determined.   While nations, regions,
classes, age-groups, men and women,   and ethnic
groups   differ culturally in some respects, they also
share, to a greater or lesser extent, cultural conventions
meanings and values.   It makes no sense, therefore, to say
that these groups   are   distinct cultures or
  have   distinct cultures.   At most we can say that
there are profound   cultural differences   between
them.   Leach, who has made this argument most forcefully in
his introduction to social anthropology, warns:
        So beware.   When you
encounter an anthropologist who writes about cultures in the
plural, or who writes as if the culture of a society were like
a unique set of clothes in which each garment can be
separately described independently of any of the others, watch
out!   In all probability the   decoupage  , the
discontinuity that separates one culture from another or one
cultural trait from another, exists only in the mind of the
anthropologist observer   (Leach,
1982:43).      
    In relation to the interpretation of ethnicity, the
plural-culture approach identified and criticised by Leach
participates in and reinforces an   ethnicisation of
culture  .   This term refers to an ideological process
through which the ethnic dimension of cultural difference is
privileged above all other dimensions.   It usually entails
an association of different cultures (plural) with different
ethnic categories or groups, and an explanation of relations
between these categories or groups primarily in terms of
differences between cultures.   The ethnicisation of culture
is thus also an idealisation of ethnicity in the sense
criticised by Miles, Spoonley and Pearson.   In other words,
taken to its logical limits, the second critique of the
'ethnicity as culture' approach (that it mistakenly equates
ethnic boundaries with cultural ones) is more profound in that
it is able to encompass the argument that the approach is
excessively idealist.  
    It is clear that the ethnicisation of culture has
significantly influenced debates about the future direction of
ethnic relations policy in New Zealand.   Perhaps less
obvious is the fact that it has also strongly influenced the
direction of ethnic relations research.   Because the
ethnicisation of culture effects an ideological backgrounding
of non-ethnic cultural differences, the study of cultural
diversity within Maori society remains a poorly developed area
of inquiry.   In particular, class, gender and generational
differences within Maori society are rarely discussed in the
'ethnicity as culture' literature in New Zealand (Larner,
1991:63).   Naive notions of a homogeneous Pakeha culture
also abound.   Finally, the extent of cultural sharing
between Maori and Pakeha is under-researched and little
understood (Spoonley, 1988:127&semi; 1991:165-166&semi; Pearson,
1990:239-247&semi; Nash, 1990:112-113&semi; Webster, 1989:55).  
    Despite scholarly challenges, the 'ethnicity as
culture' approach remains extremely influential in popular,
official and academic discourse on Maori-Pakeha relations in
New Zealand.   Part of the reason for its resilience in the
face of criticism is its firm ideological grounding in
commonsense reifications of culture.   These reifications,
or metaphors of culture, assume and 'naturalise', in a largely
unconscious way, an ethnicised understanding of culture.
  In the next section, I identify and discuss some of the
more pervasive and influential of these metaphors.   I do so
in the hope that by highlighting the largely unconscious role
that these reifications play in the ethnicisation of culture,
it is possible to gain a better general understanding of the
ideological nature of culturalist discourse.  
        Culture: Key Reifications in Ethnic Relations
Discourse      
    A survey of the literature on ethnic relations
produced in New Zealand over the last fifteen
years    1        1    The
following publications were surveyed:   references  
   suggests that the reification of culture has
clustered around five key metaphors.   These are:
M1-  Culture is food  &semi; M2-  Culture is a
stream  &semi; M3-  Culture is an environment  &semi;
M4-  Culture is a living organism  &semi; M5-  Culture is
a group  .   In what follows, I exemplify and briefly
comment on each of the above, noting significant metaphoric
entailments where relevant.  
      M1 -   Culture is food      
    This metaphor is regularly employed in discussions of
Maori education and problems experienced by young Maori.
  Thus, the Secretary of Maori Affairs, concerned about the
future of urban Maori youth, insisted that:
        Economic doors must be
unlocked and the cultural knowledge of Maoritanga passed on if
hungry generations are to be fed   (Maori Affairs,
1984:3).      
    Lack of cultural 'nourishment' is sometimes identified
as leading to low self-esteem with a consequent lack of
educational success.   Hence, culture is a nourishing source
of personal identity and self esteem.
        Maori youths raised in the
positive strengths of their culture are able to largely escape
the worst effects of this cycle of deprivation  
(Jackson, 1988:101).      
      M2 -   Culture is a stream      
    This metaphor assumes and reinforces pluralist and
relativist political positions&semi; one society, many cultures,
each, in principle, equal to all others.
        They merely wish to control
their land, resources and cultural destiny.   Surely that is
an acceptable level of devolution in a society with two main
cultural streams?   (Walker,
1987:110).      
    Perhaps this reification is related to   culture is
a spiritual essence   used in the cultural advisory group
discussions referred to earlier.   If different cultural
streams flow through a single society, then Maori culture
should flow through the bureaucratic institutions of that
society.  
      M3 -   Culture is an
environment      
    Here is a reification of culture as it has been
classically presented in anthropological writing&semi; water is to
fish as culture is to people.   In both cases, the
environment is taken-for-granted.
        As they have come out of
cultural isolation into the mainstream of New Zealand life,
the Maori people have become not less but more aware of their
identity as a group.   When we are totally immersed in our
own culture we live in it like a fish in water   (Metge,
1976:53).      
    This quotation suggests a figurative association
between this metaphor and M2 in that it is implied that Maori
people moved from a rural backwater into a  'mainstream'
environment.  
      M4 -   Culture is a living
organism      
    Seeking to counter assimilationist models and
assumptions that Maori culture is a relic of the past,
commentators regularly point to the contemporary 'living'
nature of Maori culture:
        I insisted that Maori culture
was neither dead nor dying nor a mere aggregate of survivals
but a living organism made up of functionally interrelated and
dynamically interacting parts   (Metge,
1976:318).    
        Culture is a living force
that adapts, with time, to both the physical and social
environment.   Some people may wish to freeze a
culture...   (Race Relations Conciliator,
1982:18).      
    The representation of culture as a life-form implies a
number of entailments.   As a species, culture may be
  indigenous   to a locality:
        However indifferent Pakehas
might be to Maori culture it cannot be avoided entirely
because it is indigenous and much more pervasive than people
realise   (Walker, 1987:148).      
    Irrespective of whether or not it is indigenous,
culture may   spread  :
        ...with rare exceptions all
our leadership in the religious, intelligentsia and
professional arena, married white people.   This increased
Maori women 's inferiority complexes and further spread white
culture through Maoridom   (Awatere,
1984:85).      
    The spreading of one culture may   kill off  
another:
        But kill off that culture and
Maoris will have to re-invent Black Power (which some have
done)   (Walker, 1987:220).      
    It is important, therefore, that efforts be made to
  preserve   this endangered species:
        Furthermore, as the Maoris
have strived to preserve their culture and language, their
separate identity needs to be accepted and conditions created
for its continued sustenance   (Levine and Vasil,
1985:14).      
      M5 -   Culture is a group      
    If culture is a group, then it is something to which
we   belong  , something we are   born into   and
are   part of  .   However, not all of us identify
strongly enough with our groups.   Maori generally accept
that they 'belong' to a culture but many Pakeha do not.
        There is still a distinct
Maori culture... those who clearly belong to this culture are
genuine Maori   (Mulgan, 1989:7).    
        By denying they are part of a
culture, they can deny the destructive impact that culture has
on others   (Atareta Poananga, quoted by Spoonley,
1988:67).      
    This reification often underpins more radical
rhetoric, assuming a wide range of entailments.   If
cultures are groups then, like groups, they may be
  insulted  .
        This was a confrontation
between engineering students practising what they saw as a
harmless mock haka, and a group of young Maori and Pacific
Island people, who objected to what they saw as a racist
offence against Maori culture   (Yensen et. al. eds.
1989:90).      
    Cultures may also have collective   opinions  .
  This is the central metaphor that informs Sharp 's recent
book,   Justice and the Maori  .
        And much discussion of the
relations between Maori and Pakeha did in fact take the form
of disagreements between cultures about justice  
(Sharp, 1990:32).      
    It follows that cultures may also have different
collective   aspirations  .
        Cultural sensitivity must
play a greater part in the education system - which has been
slow, in the past, to recognise the aspirations of other
cultures   (Kawharu, 1989:283).      
    Cultures may or may not   understand   each
other.
        The dominant Pakeha culture
has made too little attempt to understand minority Polynesian
cultures   (Race Relations Conciliator,
1982:12).      
    And, on the basis of misunderstandings, cultures may
  interact  .
        In the Maori perspective of
our history since 1840 the dominating theme is the interaction
of our two cultures   (  Puao-te-ata-tu  ,
1988:5).      
    Cultures may become   aggressive  .
        Pakeha culture is less well
defined than Maori culture yet, paradoxically, has a more
aggressive thrust to it   (Levine and Vasil,
1985:15-16).      
    So much so that they may   dominate and
destroy   each other.
        ...it is these very key
concepts which have allowed white culture to invade and
dominate, eliminate languages, spirituality, to destroy with a
never-ending, mind-boggling blindness.   One of these key
concepts is individualism   (Awatere,
1984:60).    
        Throughout his talk a feeling
that white culture has harnessed the forces for evil hung
unspoken in the air.   Then last week in a television
programme on the Rasta movement one man said it straight out.
  White Culture is a Force for Evil.   Makes you think.
  No other culture has survived it   (Awatere,
1984:53).      
    Cultures may   join or combine  .
        Although correct
pronunciation of Maori is a step towards bi-culturalism, the
ultimate conjunction of the two cultures occurs on marae,
especially those built in urban areas.   Increasingly
Pakehas have been exposed to marae experiences...  
(Walker, 1987:148)      
    Or they may   borrow   from each other.
        Such borrowing is part of all
cultural interaction, and does not make the 'borrowing'
culture subordinate to the one it borrows from   (Yensen
et. al. 1989:60).      
    As ethnic groups, cultures are ideally of   equal
status  . 
        Separate cultural identity
need not be threatening, and should not be, if all cultures
are acknowledged as having equal status and all ideas of
cultural superiority over one another are disposed of  
(Stokes, 1985:6).      
    One final reification, a variation on one alluded to
in the title of this article, entails a rare double metaphor:
culture is a group which is in turn a species of fish.
        The dominant culture refers
to this as assimilation.   Like a shark swallowing a
herring, it gobbles up the minority culture and although the
cells from the herring are now part of the shark - none of the
smaller fish is recognisable   (Race Relations
Conciliator, 1982: 13).      
      Culturalism and Biculturalism    
    Metaphor often directs our thinking about phenomena
into conventionally accepted channels.   In so doing, it can
act as a conservative influence, reinforcing certain
ideological modes of understanding at the expense of others
less firmly grounded in conventional imagery.   The key
metaphors identified in the previous section help naturalise
and conventionalise a culturalist understanding   of  
ethnic relations.   By implicitly asserting a direct
correspondence between ethnic and cultural boundaries, they
effect an ethnicisation of cultural difference.  
    Key metaphor M1-  culture is food  , reifies
culture as a form of ethnic nourishment, an ethnic essence
necessary for the survival of the ethnic group.   With key
metaphors M2-  culture is a stream  , and
M3-  culture is an environment  , cultural differences
(between streams or environments) are assumed to correspond to
ethnic differences.   Key metaphor M4-  culture is a
living organism  , represents culture as a localised
 'species' that lives, adapts ind dies.
      It 's    Its     relationships with other
living organisms is directly analogous to relations between
ethnic groups.   Finally, M5-  culture is a group  ,
most directly ethnicises cultural difference because it
assumes an identity between a group (an ethnic group) and a
particular culture.  
    While the prevalence of culturalist assumptions within
popular discourse about ethnic relations in New Zealand is
regrettable, their strong and continuing presence in official
and academic writing is a more serious matter.   The
ethnicisation of culture in official reports (e.g. Jackson,
1988&semi; Ministerial Advisory Committee, 1988&semi; Race Relations
Conciliator, 1982&semi; Royal Commission on Social Policy, 1987)
and academic writings (e.g. Metge, 1976&semi; Mulgan, 1989&semi; Stokes,
1985&semi; Sharp, 1990) provides a far too simplistic basis for
policy decision and academic research.   By not confronting
class, gender and generational dimensions of cultural
difference within Maori society and by idealising the logic
and processes of capitalist expansion (a world-historical
phenomenon), these and other culturalist accounts are unable
to offer radical solutions to chronic ethnic inequality in New
Zealand.  
    These weaknesses are particularly evident in the way
many commentators and policy-makers understand the concepts of
'biculturalism' and  'multiculturalism'.   To the extent that
these concepts also assume a reification of culture (as
cultures) and an ethnicisation of cultural difference, they
must also be considered as ideological, obscuring or
misrepresenting the way ethnicity is embedded within the
class-based relations of capitalism.   When New Zealand
society is conceptualised as consisting of 'two main cultural
streams', two distinct cultural 'environments' or 'worlds', an
'indigenous' and a 'non-indigenous' culture, or two cultures
that 'interact' and  'misunderstand' each other, then a great
deal more is obscured than is revealed about the nature of
ethnic inequality in New Zealand.  
      It is true, as a number of commentators have
pointed out, that biculturalism is an ambiguous concept which
has taken on a wide range of meanings in New Zealand 's ethnic
relations discourse (Pearson, 1991:203&semi; Nash, 1990:99).   At
one end of the spectrum is Schwimmer 's definition of a
bicultural society as one in which   'each culture makes
creative use of the other'  , a society in which
  'two conflicting value systems'   are each
accepted as valid (Schwimmer, 1960:13).   The view that
biculturalism means a  'more or less' equal distribution of
resources and power between Maori and Pakeha belongs at the
other, more radical, end of this spectrum (Pearson,
1990:234-236&semi; Spoonley, 1989:99).   In between are
definitions which stress greater cultural autonomy and
political influence for Maori as one of two peoples in
Aotearoa/New Zealand (Mulgan, 1989:9&semi; Yensen et. al.,
1989:15).   Strictly speaking, therefore, only those
definitions towards the conservative end of the spectrum
strongly reify culture and fully participate in the
ethnicisation of cultural difference.   Nevertheless, the
more radical proposals do take on a certain liberal
respectability by adopting a biculturalist accent.   Indeed,
I would suggest that the ideological value of biculturalism
derives in no small measure from this very ability to
encompass and fudge differences between widely divergent
political viewpoints.   In this sense, like multiculturalism
in Australia, it has become a   'necessary
ideology'   (Castles et. al., 1988, quoted by Pearson,
1991:203).  
      Conclusion    
    In naturalising and conventionalising a culturalist
understanding of ethnic relations in New Zealand, the key
metaphors with their entailments identified in this article
constitute a commonsense, and perhaps essential, grounding for
biculturalism and multiculturalism as ideological discourses.
  Any materialist social analysis must, of course, seek a
level of understanding beyond that of commonsense, and the
critique of ideology will always be an integral part of such
an endeavour.   This article has sought to contribute to the
development of such a critique by focusing on the language of
culturalism and biculturalism.   At one level, this has been
an exercise in deconstruction, a questioning of the
taken-for-granted metaphors that underpin culturalist language
in order to undermine its authority.   But by highlighting
the subtle and largely unconscious influence of culturalist
metaphors in ethnic relations discourse, this analysis also
underscores the difficulties of popularising more materialist
understandings of ethnic inequality in New Zealand.
  Indeed, it seems that in the ebb and flow of public
debate, we will be forced to witness many more replays of the
shark and the kahawai 's brief but tragic encounter.

      The Girls    
    There are nineteen Pacific Islands girls in 4 Mason.
  Most of the   girls'   parents had come to New Zealand
in the 1960s before their daughters were born&semi; from Western
Samoa (6), Cook Islands (5), Tonga (3), Niue (3), and Tokelau
(2).   Some had come in the early seventies, when the
children were young.   All except Ana had been to primary
school in New Zealand.  13     The   girls'  
accounts of why their parents came to this country are simple:
their parents came to give their children the opportunities
supposedly provided by western schooling.   As Ruth put
it:     'My parents came here for us kids even before
we were born.   They came here to get us a good school, to
get us more chances than we 'd get back home'.      
    Pakeha historians put it differently.   During the
post-war economic growth period, New Zealand governments
followed the usual pattern of western capitalist societies
such as those in Western Europe and the United States.
  They recruited migrant workers to fill labour shortages
created by the increased investment in production after the
war.   The expansion of the service and industrial sectors
of the economy attracted Pakeha urban labour out of the
relatively undesirable and low-wage jobs in other sectors of
the economy, such as production-line work.   To fill the
gaps, employers turned to other sources of labour.   One
source was the largely rural Maori population&semi; another was
provided by labour from the Pacific Islands.  14    
    To fill white-collar jobs, other immigrants were
encouraged from countries such as Britain&semi; my own English
parents were amongst these immigrants to the middle class in
the 1950s - my father worked here as an accountant and, before
the children were born, my mother was a bank clerk.   For
them, migration was a chance to capitalise on the education
won through scholarships in England in the 'good' jobs
available in a 'growing' country.  
    Such patterns of recruitment continued to cement in
the ethnic - and racist - contours of class division in New
Zealand: the last few decades have seen the establishment of
an urban Maori and Pacific Islands population which is
predominantly in the unskilled and semi-skilled sections of
the working class.   In employment terms, like Blacks in
Britain and the United State 's, Maori and Pacific Islands
Polynesians in New Zealand are disproportionately
represented in the production/service transport/labour
sector of the workforce, and extremely under-represented in
professional and managerial, clerical and sales positions
dominated by Pakeha.   In New Zealand according to the 1986
Census, 63% of the full-time Pacific Islands work force are
employed in the production, service, transport and labouring
categories, compared with 33% of total work force.  
    Not surprisingly then, the 5 Mason   girls'  
mothers and fathers are mostly employed in local production&semi;
their mothers doing machining, packing, assembling and other
production-line work, or laundry and cleaning work.   Many
of these women also have part-time or shift work - like Lisa 's
mother, who works at night as a cleaner and during the day as
a factory worker in order to both provide money for the
household as well as to look after the children.  
    The form of work experienced by the 5 Mason
  girls'   parents is characterised by requiring
little schooling and few skills, and offering low pay and
little job security.   Jobs within this section of the
labour market are typically highly controlled,  'dead end' jobs
with no career structure and little prospect of increase in
wages with experience.  
    In a stagnant economy such as at present, the fact
that Pacific Islanders are employed largely within a
subordinate section of the labour market has several
implications for the 5 Mason girls, quite aside from the issue
of schooling.   While their future forms of work may not be
exactly the same as their mothers, it seems likely that these
girls will also be employed in work which has a low demand for
skills and educational qualifications with accompanying low
pay rates, low status, little autonomy, and poor career
prospects.  
    All this is assuming that the 5 Mason girls will be
able to get paid employment.   With the economy in
recession, at the beginning of the 1980s Pacific Islands
females had an official unemployment rate of 14.5%
compared with 9.0% for non-Polynesian females.   Amongst
the 15-19 age group where unemployment is highest, the Pacific
Islands female rate was 28.4%.  15     This situation
continues.   According to the Royal Commission on Social
Policy (1988), for all ages the Pacific Islands unemployment
rates are two to three times the national average, and rates
for young Pacific Islands Polynesians are five to six
times higher than the national average.   Racism, and not
just class division, plays a role in ensuring that Pacific
Islanders remain in particular forms of work, or unemployed.
  Evidence of this is amassed daily in the Race Relations
Conciliator 's office&semi; and researchers, posing as qualified
Pacific Islands job applicants, have documented some Auckland
  employers'   discrimination against them on the
basis of race.  16    
    Clearly, this situation is not in the interests of the
Pacific Islands girls in 5 Mason.  
    The twelve Pakeha girls in 5 Simmonds exist within a
very different set of economic and social conditions.   All
of them had immigrant parents or grandparents from Britain or
Europe - some families had been here several generations.
  Their parents - particularly their fathers - are now in
professional, administrative or entrepreneurial
occupations (such as engineering, business management,
teaching).   Some of their mothers are housewives, others
are teachers, nurses, clerical workers.   Due largely to
their   fathers'   occupations, but also because of their
standard of housing, their   parents'   education level,
their level of consumption, these   girls'   families
would be popularly characterised as middle class.  
    Many of the 5 Simmonds girls travel to school each day
from out of the school zone.   Some of their mothers had
been pupils at the school&semi; they are attracted by the school 's
traditionally high academic reputation, and many are keen on
their daughters having a single-sex and multicultural school
'experience'.   In the (diminishing) heterogeneity of
the fashionable inner city suburbs around the school, some of
the 5 Simmonds and 5 Mason   girls'   families live next
door to one another, though under differing material
conditions.  
        'Naming' the girls      
    I have begun to name these girls.   Not simply in
terms of the school 's division into classes on the basis of
expectations of academic  'success', but also as   Pacific
Islands   and   Pakeha  , and   working class  
and   middle class  .  
    These terms are those from everyday life in New
Zealand.   But they are not uncontentious.   My vocabulary
inevitably marks me out as having a certain view - as I said
before, through naming the world we construct it in a
particular way.  
    Writer Albert Wendt pointed out a few years ago that
only in New Zealand is he called Pacific Islander, elsewhere
he is a Samoan.   Pacific Islander has become a local
blanket term for migrants from the southern Pacific&semi; it is a
term which illicitly conceals the historical, cultural,
political and language differences between the separate island
groups.   Thus it has real dangers.   But it also offers a
possibility - a unified identity for political struggle made
difficult for smaller groupings in New Zealand.   My use of
the term ensures my categorisation of the girls as a group&semi;
they too use this word to name themselves - in a way, it
speaks of their own new identities as they use the dominant
common language English, and interact easily together.  
    The term Pakeha, rather than the usual 'European', is
also used selfconsciously here.   I use Pakeha as a
positive cultural and political name.   Let me explain this
briefly by referring to myself.   I am Pakeha despite my
  parents'   birthplace, I am not English.   I am
culturally of this place in the South Pacific.   My accent,
aspects of my personality, my emotional ties to the land, my
knowledge - and those of my children - are rooted here.
  But nor am I simply 'a New Zealander' along with every
other person in this country&semi; that term 's meaning is too
diffuse, and so all-encompassing as to only meaningfully
refer to a physical location.   Rather, my culture and
identity are deeply influenced by that of the indigenous
inhabitants, and indeed, established in relation to them: were
Maori never here, I would not be Pakeha, and vice versa - we
are named in relation to each other: Maori - 'common' or
ordinary person&semi; Pakeha - (fair) stranger, or perhaps 'other'.
  Were I an inhabitant of the other Pacific Islands I would
be named   palangi/palagi/papa'a  .  
    Thus, here I refer to the European girls in 5 Simmonds
as Pakeha in positive recognition of their cultural location
in the Pacific.   What might count as these   girls'  
culture will become more important later on.  
    I have also named the girls in terms of class.
  Race and class are usually inextricably linked&semi; in New
Zealand it is clear that to be Polynesian - whether indigenous
Maori or Pacific Islands - is usually to be working class.
  Some New Zealanders reject altogether the relevance of
class for an understanding of this society.   They still
look to Britain, and because (they think) we do not have the
very obvious social class differences evident in the accents
and lifestyles of the English, assume that classes do not
exist here.  
    However, most would agree that in the sense of
difference based on access to wealth, power and status, there
are social classes in New Zealand.   They would accept that
some groups benefit more than others from the organisation of
work and the economy.   These days, in common usage at
least, class pays little homage to the old Marxist definitions
where 'working class' refers to those who engage in productive
work (producing goods and providing services) which in
capitalism is controlled by, and largely benefits, others&semi;
where middle class refers to those engaged in maintaining,
organising, legitimating (and benefiting from) the conditions
of capitalist production - in the  'middle', as it were,
between the 'productive' workers and the owners (the major
beneficiaries) of international capital.  
    Most commonly, class refers vaguely - and often
    perjoratively    pejoratively     - to
lifestyles and attitudes, and maybe to people 's form of work.
  You 're working class if you are employed in work which is
usually relatively undesirable, probably boring, often poorly
paid.   You are often Maori or Pacific Islands.   You 're
working class if you can't afford a holiday, health food,
insurance or dentists&semi; if you own a video but not a going car.
  You 're middle class if you 're yuppie, privileged, you
(rather guiltily) own a three-bedroomed house for four people
while in the next suburb six people live in one room, in a
garage or worse.   You 're environment and health-food
'conscious', and concerned about social inequality.   You
are usually Pakeha.   You have good job conditions and
good pay and all that goes with those.  
    While this sort of idea of class might seem rather
silly and inaccurate, and to owe nothing to Marx, it
nevertheless reflects a general sense of the structure of the
social and economic relations of work in capitalism: it is an
expression of the privilege, and power, of some sections of
the labour force.  
    Social scientists usually avoid referring to class
altogether by using instead the term socio-economic status
(SES) and dividing the population into occupational categories
or SES groups ranked in terms of the occupation 's perceived
social status, pay and educational level.   A problem with
this sort of categorisation is that it tends to group together
people (such as housewives and unemployed) who have very
different conditions of life&semi; it tells us nothing about how
the economy works at the level of society, nothing about which
groups benefit from the organisation of the economy.  
    But I am not interested here in discussing 'class' in
the abstract.   I want to explore the ways in which class in
New Zealand 'works', how it becomes significant in schooling.
  In this sense, class can be understood through its ongoing
operation in the classroom.  
    By naming the girls in terms of class here I have made
central a particular idea: that a key to their differential
schooling might be found in the forms of work (paid and
unpaid) performed by their parents, and potentially to be
performed by the girls.   Without unpacking this idea too
much, because it will engage us in detail further on, I will
signal the direction of my thinking from my notes, introducing
a strand of the argument to be taken up and woven in with
several others.  
            What aspect of class is really
useful in looking at how teaching and learning works for
certain groups in the classroom?   It is not just the fancy
computers, clothes, holidays, books or the desk space at home
of some groups compared with others.   One thing which
characterises middle-class work (paid or unpaid) is the degree
of control over what counts as socially valued knowledge.
  Most people think about control over capital such as money
or property when they think about the privilege of
middle-class people.   But capital can also be symbolic.
  Having those skills, social traits, know-how which are
made valuable in the operation of the dominant scientific,
management, technological and artistic enterprises in New
Zealand is a form of capital.   So is 'ownership' of what
counts as the dominant culture: those values, norms, ways of
acting, thinking, speaking which are generally considered
to be 'competent' or admirable.   In other words, having
socially valued traits or knowledge - and the ability to
transmit these (say to one 's family) - can be seen as just as
much an aspect of the privilege or the power of certain
classes as the ability to directly transmit money or property.
  This is because the acquisition and use of symbolic or
cultural capital is an intrinsic part of the process of
maintaining economic and social
privilege.        
    How does schooling come into this?   The school - as
well as the family - can be seen as an important agent in this
acquisition.   Indeed, the transmission and exercise of
cultural capital can be seen as central to understanding
schooling.   From this point of view, it might be expected
that the 5 Simmonds girls, as members of that class (and
ethnic) group which 'controls' what counts as valuable
knowledge and culture in schooling and other social
institutions, would be enabled through the school to use and
acquire the skills, beliefs, expectations, knowledge and
qualifications (the cultural capital) which will provide them
with access to  'middle-class' jobs.   We might expect that
the school does not (can not?) enable this for the Pacific
Islands girls.   The question is, of course, how is this
happening in the classroom right now?   (It is worth
pointing out here that what counts as cultural capital is
usually understood in the terms of the dominant society.
  Some of the 5 Mason   girls'   fathers and mothers
hold highly knowledgeable and powerful positions within their
own social and church structures.   In these contexts, such
women and men would be considered to have a great degree of
cultural capital.   But within the economic and social
structures of the dominant society this capital usually has
less value.)  
    If all these abstractions seem difficult to grasp, it
is probably because they don't make a huge amount of sense
outside an account of how cultural capital, just like class,
'works' in a concrete site like the classroom.   That will
be my task in the following chapters.   In the meantime, I
sit in the classroom, and these thoughts are in my head as I
read and think, and read some more in order to frame and make
sense of the   girls'   everyday activities at school.  
    I suspect that the direction of my thinking does not
gel with that of the Pacific Islands girls in 5 Mason.
  Some ask: Why focus on 'the economic side of things'?
  One could focus on spiritual fulfilment or personal
happiness instead - why are economic conditions so important?
  I confront this question early on, because most of the
Pacific Islands girls consider that one 's spiritual happiness,
or at least one 's goodness, is 'the most important thing in
life'.   Doing God 's work, following His word, are
ultimately of far higher value than getting good
qualifications and a good job.   All the better when both
things can be done at once: working hard to do well at school
is doing God 's work - and laziness (a reason for school
failure) is not.   And anyway, as Repeka put it, God didn't
intend for everyone to be brainy, He needs some people to do
the  'stink' jobs.  
    If I were a fundamentalist Christian, the focus of my
research might well be about the achievement of goodness and
divinely-ordered happiness, possible even in poorly paid,
boring jobs.   But my interests are different.   I agree
with Marx that our work makes us human, and that material
conditions shape our consciousness as well as the texture of
our everyday lives.   A decent income and interesting or
fulfilling work determine the basic contours of our lives
within contemporary New Zealand: the comfort of our housing,
the state of our health, the stress on our family
relationships, the ease of transport, the variety of our food,
the level of our leisure consumption, the extent to which we
can support children and other family members, our feeling of
autonomy and general wellbeing.   Hence my concern with the
economic.  
        Class and gender      
    In attempting to clarify things, I have perhaps
oversimplified.   I have glossed over the fact that many of
the middle-class   girls'   mothers do not have jobs with
the degree of autonomy and financial reward which I have said
characterises middle-class work.   I seem to have used the
  girls'     fathers'   occupations as a measure of
their class membership - which is hardly reasonable when it is
young women 's life trajectories I am interested in.   Many
feminists would argue that the 5 Mason and 5 Simmonds girls
are not so easily divided into two class groups: that they
have more in common than is being expressed here - as women
the conditions of their work and lives may not be too
dissimilar in the future.  
    Some feminist researchers  17   have argued that
regardless of their ethnicity or their husband 's or father 's
social class, women are massively over-represented in
unpaid domestic work (housewives) and, compared with men as a
group, are disproportionately in paid work which have a higher
degree of job insecurity, low economic return, little
responsibility and limited chances for advancement which are
the characteristics of 'working class' jobs.   Women as a
group are usually found in a narrow range of occupations such
as cleaning, catering, teaching children, clothing-machining,
nursing, shop assistants and office work.   This work is
seen as 'women 's work' because it reflects the tasks which
women do in the home and consequently it suffers from low
status and wages.  
    Other feminists (like Madeline MacDonald) point out
that there are major divisions between working-class and
middle-class women in terms of their control over cultural
capital.   By definition working-class women (and men) have
little or no ownership of cultural capital.   On the other
hand, employed middle-class women and men produce, legitimise
and maintain the existing culture through their positions in
'cultural', media, educational, social service, and
administrative areas of work.   Middle-class women who
perform domestic work in the home and play a major role in
child-rearing also engage in transmitting to their children
valuable cultural or symbolic capital.  
    Obviously we cannot complete any proper analysis of
  girls'   schooling and labour market experience without
recognising that gender relations have a crucial effect on the
sorts of employment sought by and available to women in New
Zealand - including the 5 Mason and 5 Simmonds girls.   But
nor can we simply gloss over the major differences between
these   girls'   economic and social opportunities.  
    By way of illustrating these complexities let us look
briefly at the future experience of two girls: Martha (a young
working-class Pacific Islands Polynesian from 5 Mason) and
Sue (a young middle-class Pakeha from 5 Simmonds), who
initially got similar sorts of jobs on leaving school.  
    Martha lives in an older part of the inner city&semi; her
mother is a process worker and her father is employed as an
assembler.   Martha left   Girls'   High after four and
a half   years'   secondary schooling with one School
Certificate subject.   She didn't particularly want to leave
school, but said she couldn't  'stay for ever', and besides,
she wanted to earn some money.   She got a job in a local
fast-food bar, and left after three weeks because she 'hated'
the work.   She then worked temporarily as a shop assistant
selling light-fittings - all she could get.   She was
unemployed for three months, then got a job selling shoes in a
more distant suburban shopping centre.   Transport problems
led her to leaving that job after six weeks.   She then got
a job with a small local firm as a 'girl Friday' - filing,
taking phone messages, making tea.   She stayed in that job
for eighteen months, then became pregnant, left the wage
labour force, and married her boyfriend, a colour-mixer at a
paint factory in a distant industrial area.  
    Sue 's mother is a drama teacher and her father is an
architect&semi; they live in an expensive inner-city suburb.
  Sue is well known at school for her unconventional
hairstyles.   She left   Girls'   High after four years,
with University Entrance.   She was bored with school and
wanted to travel overseas so decided to earn some money.
  She got a job through a friend in a fashionable city
record shop.   After working there nearly two years, as well
as doing a part-time waitressing job, she left for Britain.
  She returned after about two years and worked briefly in
the record shop again.   She then enrolled at University and
took a part-time job delivering health food products to retail
outlets.   She graduated from university with a B.A. in
English and Art History and then became pregnant.   Her de
facto husband is a television journalist.  
    The conditions of both young women 's waged work
until their first pregnancy were similar: their service jobs
included little opportunities for advancement, poor pay and
low autonomy.   Nevertheless, Sue and Martha 's respective
access to money, further education, housing and employment in
the future will be quite different.   Through the use of her
educational credentials and other symbolic capital, Sue 's
future conditions of paid work (or domestic work) offer her
far more possibilities than those facing Martha.  
    This class pattern is even more evident in the
collective differences between the experiences of the majority
of the 5 Simmonds and 5 Mason girls.   Martha 's experiences
reflect those of many 5 Mason girls in that they often left
school with few qualifications and got jobs they were not
particularly interested in (see Chapter 8).   Sue, on the
other hand, is quite unusual compared with her classmates.
  Most 5 Simmonds girls in fact stayed on at school, heading
for tertiary study at university.   They hoped to become
doctors, teachers, architects.  
    Of course, the sexual division of labour may ensure
that the 5 Simmonds   girls'   more 'ambitious' hopes are
never realised.   Insofar as Martha and Sue - and
working-class and middle-class women in general - are often
limited to a particular segment of the labour market and
domestic work, they share an interest in the destruction of
the sexual division of labour and the gender relations which
tend to relegate women within all classes to subordinate
positions in relation to men in that class, and which make
women vulnerable to male violence and control.   But despite
the fact that all the girls would benefit from a non-sexist
society, the commonality of their interests is limited by
economic class.  18    
    This book is an attempt to spell out some of the ways
in which schools might contribute to maintaining those class
patterns experienced by Sue and Martha, and their
peers.      
  

          Maori   and   Pakeha  
Updated: Cultural Sensitivity and the   Heinemann New
Zealand Dictionary      
  TONY DEVERSON
    This paper examines the differences between the
entries for   Maori   and   Pakeha   in the first
and second editions of the   Heinemann New Zealand
Dictionary   (  HNZD1   and   HNZD2  ).
  These entries, reproduced below, raise some interesting
matters of lexicographical practice, and also some of the more
sensitive issues relating to New Zealand English (NZE) at the
present time - and especially the accommodation and use of
Maori loanwords in NZE.    
    All English teachers will know of the   HNZD  ,
and its pioneering status as the first such local work.
  Indeed it is still the only genuine New Zealand-produced
dictionary, since other dictionaries with New Zealand content
are either British or Australian based (  The New Zealand
Pocket Oxford Dictionary   or   The Penguin Tasman
Dictionary  , for example).   A second, substantially
revised edition of the   HNZD   was published late last
year, ten years after the first.   The first edition had
enormous novelty value, and it had many admirers, though it
was never going to displace the   Concise Oxford   as
the preferred reference work for English practitioners.   It
still won't do that, especially now that the   Concise  
is out in a brand new and rather awesome eighth edition
(1990), but the second edition of   HNZD   should be
taken much more seriously than the first&semi; it is a
significantly improved work, and one of a number of reasons
for this is the expansion of its New Zealand content and in
particular the Maori-derived vocabulary in NZE.   There are
very many more Maori loanwords listed, and the treatment of
some of the basic items (like the term   kiwi  ) is now
much more convincing and comprehensive.  
    The focus here is on the entries for just two words,
  Maori   and   Pakeha  , but they are two crucial
words which resonate with all kinds of intercultural and
personal associations: they are both at times 'loaded' and
controversial items.   As key terms in the lives of all New
Zealanders, they certainly present a challenge to any
lexicographer 's skills, not to say nerve.  
    It 's clear that both entries have been completely
recast for the 1989 edition.   The substantial changes
suggest a fairly profound dissatisfaction on the part of the
dictionary-makers with the original efforts when they came to
revise them.   Very little indeed remains from the earlier
versions&semi; little more than the part of speech labels, and in
the   Maori   entry a few capitalised words such as
'Polynesian'.   The first thing that one notices is that the
  Maori   entry is now much longer, and it 's made so
mostly through an extended treatment of the word as an
attributive adjective&semi; this usage is merely stated, with no
elaboration, in the first edition.  
    What then are the reasons for this near-total
rewriting?   It 's plainly not the case that the referents
denoted by the words have changed, so the motivation for
changing the entries must lie elsewhere.   It appears there
are two principal impulses behind the changes under
discussion.   We might call these the   scientific  
and the   humanist   respectively, and rather
predictably there is at times a tension, even a conflict,
between them.   They don't always go harmoniously hand in
hand.   The scientific impulse is the wish to make the
entries more accurate, more informative, and of sufficient
substance to mark the   words'   high profile in our
vocabularies (more complete in other words).   Apart from
the new material on the adjectival   Maori   already
noted (more of which below), another example of this intention
can be seen at the ends of the 1989 entries in the etymologies
provided.  
    In place of no etymology (for   Maori  ) or just
the name of the donor language   (for Pakeha)   before,
we now have in both instances the language, the
typographically exact modern Maori form of the source word
(complete with macrons for vowel length as recommended by the
Maori Language Commission), and in the case of   Maori  
grammatical and semantic information about the word
  Maori   in Maori.   Thus   Maori   comes from
  Maori   in Maori&semi; we know that - and a good deal else
in the dictionary - informally already, but the lexicographer
makes it quite precise.  
    But what I 've called the   humanist   motive
behind the changes may be the more interesting of the two.
  What I mean by this is the wish to reflect enlightened
social attitudes and practices (and changing attitudes), and
above all to respect cultural sensitivities when it comes to
the adoption of Maori words for English purposes.   It 's
possible this impulse has operated less consciously than the
other, but it is certainly at work here (and more strongly
felt in the second than in the first edition).   From the
Pakeha lexicographer 's viewpoint it 's a matter of adopting a
bicultural view, and of making every effort to avoid the
offence that Maori can be expected to take (and understandably
so) at anything they perceive to be disrespectful treatment of
or reference to te reo Maori.   It is appropriate to say (in
the spirit of 1990) that in effect this is a matter of
acknowledging the Treaty of Waitangi in the writing of
dictionary entries, of being true to the Treaty 's statements
of equal partnership and status.  
    As an example of this influence one can look first at
the whole entry for   Maori   in the first edition.
  Ten years ago many of us would have looked at that entry
and not turned a single hair.   But now, surely, there is
something profoundly disturbing about having   'as
cunning as a Maori dog'   cited as the sole example of
usage of the word   Maori  .   Even visually
(typographically) the bold-type   cunning   in the
midst of a triple bold-type   Maori   makes an
unfortunate connection.   It is not difficult to see how
this might be interpreted as giving not just the Maori dog but
the Maori themselves a bad name.   And it is scarcely
surprising then that the idiom in question has vanished
altogether from the dictionary (though certainly not from the
language) ten years later.  
    In the first edition the entry for   Maori  
itself is followed by separate entries for nine compounds in
which Maori is used as premodifying adjective:   Maori
Battalion, Maori oven  , etc.   Among these there is just
one,   Maori P.T.  , which illustrates the derogatory
meaning these formations sometimes have, where an unfavourable
racial stereotype is presented through an ironic or
paradoxical coinage.     Maori   in such compounds in
effect means 'the opposite of' or 'an unusual type of'
something (  Maori P.T.   is unenergetic behaviour,
loafing around,   a Maori sidestep   in rugby is a
head-on charge,   Maori overdrive   is coasting downhill
in neutral, and so on).   But there is just one example of
this quite productive process in   HNZD1   (it 's marked
  offensive  ), and there is no acknowledgement of it in
the main entry.  
    By contrast in 1989 there   is   recognition of
this ironic usage, but its impact is considerably softened,
and the derogatoriness downplayed, by enclosing it in a more
comprehensive treatment of adjectival expressions.   To some
extent, it 's 'buried in the fine print'.   Three of these
adjectival uses are entirely uncontroversial (and informative)
(1a, 2a, 2b), while the other one is not defined (1b), merely
glossed as possibly derogatory or stereotypical.  
    Returning for a moment to the entries following the
main one, instead of nine in   HNZD1  , there are now as
many as thirty-six in   HNZD2  , but if one is looking
for more of the   Maori P.T.   type one looks in vain.
  Furthermore   Maori P.T.   has been removed from the
earlier list (all the others remain), and the only item among
the additional twenty-eight entries that exemplifies the same
usage and is marked offensive, is   Maori cannon  , and
that is the one used as example in 1b in the main entry.
  So there is still just one example, but a different one.
  What then is a Maori cannon?   It 's a term not from the
field of war, but from the field of billiards.   A cannon in
billiards is a double hit, and a   Maori cannon   is
defined as   'a blunder at billiards'   (or
pool?).   Scarcely familiar territory for the average
Heinemann dictionary user, one might say, and there is a
suggestion that   Maori cannon   has been deliberately
selected ahead of one or more potentially more emotive
examples of this usage that clearly embody the racist
stereotype.  
    The cautious but sensitive Heinemann treatment of this
usage contrasts strikingly with David McGill 's less inhibited
approach in his two recent collections of New Zealand slang
(  A Dictionary of New Zealand Slang   1988,   The
Dinkum Kiwi Dictionary   1989).   McGill 's is a narrower
province, and it 's mostly the derogatory formation rather than
the neutral   Maori oven   type that comes under his
heading of slang.   So there are several such expressions in
each book carefully annotated as   offensive  , even
  doubly offensive  , but paraded there nevertheless for
entertainment in full view of those who might take the
offence.   (Although many readers may find a large part of
the contents of these books offensive for one reason or
another, the label   offensive   in McGill is a
privilege reserved solely for these expressions,   Maori
roast   and the like).  
    There appear to be two contradictory trends in the
changes that have to do with the adjectival   Maori   in
the   HNZD  .   The scientific concern for
informativeness and thoroughness is represented by the
additional content in the main entry and the large number of
extra compounds now listed after it.   However, the humanist
concern not to provoke offence results first in the omission
of a clear definition of the derogatory use of   Maori  
as an adjective, and then in the illustration of it both in
the main entry and the following compounds by a single,
esoteric and relatively uncontroversial (and rather
unrepresentative) item.   The following compounds are
selected to the virtual exclusion of one of the four
subcategories of adjectival usage specified, and yet that one
is surely no less a part of NZE than the other three.
  Indeed, it could be argued that these derogatory items are
in more need of inclusion than something like   Maori
celery  , say, or   Maori jasmine  , because their
meaning, being ironic, is not transparent.   It 's difficult
to escape the conclusion that there 's a suppression of
vocabulary going on here, well motivated certainly, but
bringing the scholarly, scientific aims of lexicography into
conflict with more humane motives.   A degree of
explicitness and comprehensiveness is sacrificed to avoid
alienating some New Zealanders.  
    There are a number of other notable changes in these
entries between the first and second editions.   One element
in the entries is the indication of pronunciation.   The
pronunciation of Maori words in NZE has been an emotive issue
for at least a hundred years, and this is another area in
which the lexicographer must tread carefully.   In the case
of   Maori  , the change between the 1979 and 1989
entries is only apparent, the second edition uses a different
key for Maori pronunciation (to be found in the 'grey pages'
at the back of the book), and the indicated and in effect
recommended pronunciation is the same as before.   Both
editions have therefore advocated a formal, Maori-style
pronunciation&semi; the only quarrel one might have with this is
that since more fully Anglicised pronunciations are given as
alternatives for some other common Maori loanwords (such as
  kowhai  ) there is an inconsistency in the treatment
of Maori, for which there is a long-standing Anglicised form
in Pakeha speech.   Again it is, one assumes, the special
importance of the word that motivates the more prescriptive
and diplomatic stance here.   For   Pakeha  ,  the
second edition   does   provide
    and    an     Anglicised form (with /h/
elided), in addition to the Maori-style pronunciation that
stood alone in the first edition.   Thoroughness here seems
to enjoy a minor victory over humanist motives, but
  '  par  kee-are'   is certainly not as
commonly heard as Anglicised forms of   Maori.    
    Another change in the 1989 entry for   Pakeha  
is the capitalisation of the word.   This reflects changing
practice, but upper case is still not universally favoured (as
readers of   The Press   in Christchurch will be aware),
and so there 's an element of mild prescription again: upper
case is the preferred usage of biculturalist opinion.   For
comparison the   New Zealand Pocket Oxford   gives both
forms, lower case first, while the new   Concise  
continues to list the word only in lower case (though
  '(NZ) white man'   of the seventh edition has
thankfully become   'white person, as opposed to a
Maori'   in the eighth).  
    Another addition to the   Maori   entry in
  HNZD2   is the grammatical information regarding
plural use.   This is another rather sensitive issue,
analogous to the pronunciation of Maori loanwords&semi; that is,
the question is, to Anglicise (by inflexion) or not to
Anglicise (leaving the plural uninflected as in the donor
language).     HNZD2   hedges its bets here and gives
both possibilities, but practice in this matter has changed
very rapidly in the last year or two, and the
dictionary-makers may already be wishing they had at least put
the uninflected plural first, since that has established
itself as the politically correct form in the media and
elsewhere.   Last year the   journalists'   union
decided that   Maori   was the only plural to be used by
its members, and whether because of the effects of that
decision alone or not,   Maoris   (sic) already seems
improper and impolitic, rather as words like
  chairman   or   actress   are for different
reasons.   There is the same kind of socially responsible
linguistic engineering here as in the rejection of sexist
terminology, and it arouses the same kinds of reactionary
response from some.  
      What applies to   Maori   in terms of plural
formation, by implication applies to all nouns borrowed from
Maori (for example the plurals of   kauri   and
  kea   are   kauri   and   kea  ), and this
includes   Pakeha  , though there is no note on plural
forms provided here, or indeed with any other
    Moari    Maori     loanword in the dictionary.
    Maori   once again is the test case, and its
significance has been duly acknowledged in the revised
entry.  
    Finally, there is the semantic component, the
all-important definitions, always the central focus of
dictionary entries, and the main rationale for these
wordbooks.   The definitions of   Maori   and
  Pakeha   are considerably changed in the second
edition.   Discussion of the merits of the paraphrases given
in the two editions is not called for here, but one very
striking feature of the new   Maori   entry first, is
the use of   'tangata whenua'   in the main
definition.   This may go against the sound lexicographical
principle that you should not use in a definition any word
that is likely to be less familiar than the word you are
defining (though   tangata whenua   is now considerably
less unfamiliar in this country than ten or even five years
ago)&semi; however that principle becomes secondary here to the
evident wish to define   Maori   as far as possible from
a Maori perspective, using a precise Maori term (to which in
turn an English gloss is then added).   To my knowledge this
is the first time in an English dictionary that one Maori
loanword has been used directly to define another.
    HNZD2   shows appropriate consideration for Maori
in doing this&semi; it 's tactful, in tune with the times, and it
epitomises the best aspects of the changes under review
here.  
      Pakeha   is less easy than   Maori   to
define because its range of reference is not so precisely
delimited.   Are Pakeha New Zealanders only?   If not,
what other groups might the word refer to?   Are Pakeha just
New Zealanders of British or European extraction or not?
  These questions are difficult to answer.   The changes
in   HNZD2   include dropping from the 1979 entry the
obsolete sense 2 (wasn't such a person more usually called a
'Pakeha Maori'?), and removing the word 'European' from sense
1.   In the new edition   Pakeha   is defined as an
antonym of   Maori   (  'non-Maori'  ),
which makes the definition more New Zealand-oriented, and
above all more Maori-oriented.   Maori is the unmarked
category, and Pakeha becomes the marked, which is appropriate
to the historical development of this country.   Further on
there is a matching statement to the one in the
  Maori   entry concerning the possible offensive use of
the adjectival   Pakeha   by
  'non-Pakeha'  &semi; however there 's no illustration
of this.   'Non-Pakeha' we can only take to mean Maori: it 's
an antonym of (the more commonly heard) 'non-Maori'.   Both
'non-Pakeha' and 'non-Maori' (which might warrant their own
entries in the dictionary, but don't get them) are plainly
euphemistic in a well-intentioned sense, and yet another
instance of the   lexicographers'   sensitive approach to
their task of revision.  
    An overall verdict on the revision of these entries is
generally favourable, with just one or two reservations, for
example, over what might be thought a slight failure of nerve
in respect of demonstrating the pejorative adjectival use of
  Maori  .   Two concluding observations may be made.
  One is that while lexicographers fundamentally adopt a
scientific approach there are unavoidable limitations and
compromises involved in their work, both in terms of
constraints of space and time, and in terms of having only
words (which can be very blunt instruments) with which to
define and explain other words.   Lexicography is both an
inherently imperfect science, and a most difficult art.
  These revised entries do a better job of indicating the
sense and tone and usage of   Maori   and
  Pakeha   than the superseded ones, but they cannot be
regarded as the whole truth&semi; some of the nuances and
associations (and uses) inevitably still escape the scientific
net.   For more     defnitive    definitive    
entries yet, we can look forward to Harry Orsman 's
  Dictionary of New Zealand English  , compiled on
historical principles&semi; this has now been designated an
official 1990 project, and is due for publication in 1991.  
    The final observation is that dictionaries reflect
social changes not merely in updating the set of words which
they select for inclusion and description (so that
  HNZD2   like the new   Concise Oxford   has many
of the words of the 1980s like   perestroika   and
  user-friendly  )&semi; but dictionaries may (and in the
case of these two entries certainly do) also mirror social
trends and attitudes in the content and presentation of the
entries themselves.   Updating a dictionary means more than
just updating the list of words&semi; it also requires careful
attention to changes in the perceptions and connotations of
words, especially those of particular note at a given time.
  The revisers of the   HNZD   should be commended for
being responsive to the changing climate of race relations and
linguistic attitudes in Aotearoa/New Zealand in the 1980s, and
for changing the entries for   Maori   and
  Pakeha   accordingly in a careful and enlightened
manner.      
  

          5      
      Violence Away    
    Statistically, New Zealanders display very much the
same range of violent activities as any other Western
industrial society.   Homicide, assault, rape, vandalism,
arson, and other offences against the person and against
property are found everywhere.   Such acts are seen by the
public as a rising tide of lawlessness remorselessly pressing
against the thin barricades of law and order and the agencies
of control.   Is this an appropriate perception?  
    All of this gets due, and sometimes undue, attention
in the media and contributes to a sort of on-going industry.
  At each election, the law and order issue is hauled out,
dusted off and hawked around the countryside, usually
resulting in a promise of action.   The action which follows
usually consists of a committee or commission whose reports in
future will doubtless be greatly facilitated by the recycling
of previous reports through the word processor.   Between
elections, governments tinker with penalties and the
definition of offences, manipulate the numbers in the police
force and respond to the eruption of public outrage that often
follows a particularly dramatic criminal incident.   Why
some such incidents are responded to in this way and others
are ignored has a lot to do with the time of the year, the
marginality of the government 's majority, and who happens to
be pushing the bandwagon.   But whenever and why it starts
to move, its passage and progress are fairly predictable.
  Violence in our society is not random, it is patterned.
  And so, too, are our reactions to it.  
    The Department of Justice submission to the Committee
of Inquiry into violence in 1986 included information on all
the murders committed between 1950 and 1985   (49)  .
  While the number of murders fluctuates from year to year
(there were twenty-five in 1981 but only seven in 1982), there
has been a steady increase over the years.   The average
number of murders between 1960 and 1964 was six.   For the
five-year period twenty years later (1980-4), this had risen
to twenty-seven.   The annual figure starts to rise after
1975.   Other violent offences have also risen steadily.
  In 1985 there were eleven times as many violent offences
as in 1960.  
    Six per cent of the 202 murderers were female and 94
per cent male.   This ratio did not change over the period
of the study.   Sixty-one per cent of the murderers had
previous criminal records, but the proportion of murderers who
have histories of violent offending has increased in recent
years.   Of those who committed murder between 1960 and
1969, 23 per cent had convictions for violent offending,
compared with nearly half (48 per cent) of those who committed
murder between 1980 and 1985.  
    The educational level of murderers changed little over
the period of the study.   Only 10 per cent of murderers in
the 1980s had managed to progress beyond the third form,
compared to 4 per cent in the period between 1960 and 1969.
  The average age of murderers has changed little over the
decades, remaining at about twenty-nine&semi; the murderers in the
study ranged in age from fourteen to sixty-eight.  
    Another feature that has remained constant has been
the proportion of victims known to their murderers - about
three-quarters.   Nearly a third of the victims were family
members.   So far this report has revealed an extraordinary
sociological predictability in the background of
murderers.  
    Two factors have changed markedly over the years.
  One is the proportion of unemployed who feature in the
homicide statistics.   Until about 1970, only 16 per cent of
the murderers were out of work at the time of the murder but
the percentage has risen to 55 per cent in the 1980s.   Of
course over this decade unemployment increased dramatically in
the total population, so the change is in employment, not in
the nature of murder or murderers.   The second change
relates to the number of murderers who were Maori.   In the
first two decades of the study (1950-69), 23 per cent of
committed murderers were Maori, a figure which rose in the
1970s to 25 per cent and in the 1980s to 48 per cent.   The
label 'Maori' may be meaningless in this context, since we
know nothing of how culturally Maori these offenders are.
  Before anything can be concluded from these statistics
they need to be placed in the context of general social trends
such as unemployment, migration, and family breakdown.  
    In all this statistical information, it is difficult
to see anything unique about New Zealand homicides and
assaults.   They have increased in proportion to economic
hardship and social deprivation.   The government and the
public at large find it convenient to focus attention upon the
crime rates and the criminals because the social and economic
problems which lie behind them are so difficult to resolve.
  Yet by world standards, New Zealand cities and streets,
homes, and parks are safe places, even though they have become
less so in the last decade   (7)  .   And our
homicide rate of 2.2 per 100,000 of population is similar to
that of England (2.24), lower than that of Australia (2.73),
and much, much lower than that of the USA (9.60)
  (119)  .  
    Much of the increase in violent offending is
associated with crimes against property.   Property crime is
almost everywhere committed by the deprived against the
privileged.   Theft, burglary, and robbery are crimes of
gain.   Vandalism and arson are crimes of destruction.
  Car theft may have a range of motive reason: joy-riding,
lack of transport, bravado, sale or plunder, or simply the
desire to wreck.   If killing occurs in association with
these property crimes the context is very different from that
of intentional homicide.  
    However, crime statistics must be interpreted with
caution.   The use of percentages in isolation can imply an
exaggerated increase in low frequency crimes.   Different
ways of defining crimes or gathering statistics, and
differences in policing methods can affect reported crime
rates.  
    Newspaper headlines can contribute to public alarm.
  'Soaring Violence in Crime Concerns' (  Waikato
Times  , 25 August 1989) headlines an article which records
that although current crime had risen nationally by 7.5 per
cent, homicides had dropped by the same amount and seven
districts had actually reported drops in crime overall.
  Nevertheless, any increase in crime, however small,
provides an opportunity for a Police Association spokesperson
to lament the lack of police resources, and for Opposition
politicians to berate the government of the day for being
 'soft' on crime.  
    Rape has received a great deal of attention from the
public and from both political parties.   Rape is the only
crime where the victim is often as much on trial as the
accused and in which, because it is unlikely that there will
be independent witnesses, the prosecution will have difficulty
in securing a conviction.   In 1981 there were sixty-four
rape convictions&semi; this had risen to seventy-nine in 1985.
  However, in 1984 there were 381 complaints of rape, of
which the police decided to prosecute fewer than a third (29
per cent).   Of the 111 cases prosecuted, a conviction was
obtained in eighty cases (72 per cent), although this means
that only 21 per cent of the rapes initially reported to the
police resulted in a conviction   (224)  .
  Criminologist Warren Young has estimated that only 4 per
cent of rapes ever result in a prosecution   (259)  .
  Is it any wonder that victims of rape who initiate and
then suffer the ordeal of police and court procedures often
ask themselves if it was worth it?    
    A major symposium on rape was held in 1981
  (143)   and a two-volume study was issued in 1983 by
the Department of Justice   (48)  .   There are a
number of issues which lie behind this attention.   There
are serious problems within the criminal justice system in
dealing with evidence, the difficulty of conviction, and the
feminist view that the justice system, in this area, is far
from just.   Attitudes to sexuality have become more
liberal, which may also have led some men to believe they have
a greater right of sexual access to women.   Society has
become suddenly more liberal in respect of pornography, and
the depiction of male sexual violence has become quite
fashionable, even in G-rated movies, videos and TV
 'soaps'.  
    There has been a cost involved in 'taking the wraps
off' rape.   When it was a taboo subject, there was less
inducement to copy-cat crime.   Rape has become almost a
badge of membership in some groups in our society.  
    Rape is denied by both men and women.   Some men
still think, 'I bet she asked for it' or  'she probably
deserved it'.   Others distance themselves from the
perpetrator by claiming that no  'decent' man would ever do
such a thing.   There are women, too, who say,  'she must
have asked for it, walking at night like that.   I don't
walk at night alone therefore it won't happen to me'.   The
attitude that 'only sluts get raped' still prevails.  
    Of all the violent crimes, rape has generated the most
myths in popular folklore   (33, 224)  .   Contrary
to public belief, most rapes are not committed on the streets
at night by a stranger but at the home of either the victim or
the rapist by someone who is very often known to the victim
  (39)  .   Women do not get raped because they
flaunt their sexuality: victims can be any female - from
little girls to very old women.   Rapists are not always
either young men in the full flush of sexual desire or  'dirty
old men'.   They too cover the whole age range.  
    While less recent literature   (4)   suggests
that anger and hostility towards the woman victim, rather than
sexual lust, is an important motivation, modern perspectives
regard rape as an act of power, of domination
  (224)  .   Most rapists are not sexually deprived
but are either in regular sexual relationships or have licit
sex available to them if they seek it.   The purchase of sex
on the streets is available to all men.   But that is not
what the rapist is after.   There is also the myth that
rapists are sexually inadequate but this, too, is not the
case.   The sexually inadequate peep or flash or seek out
children   (14)  .  
    These myths are carried in the collective
consciousness of our society.   They are perpetrated through
literature, movies, and videos.   Especially pernicious is
the scenario where the woman resists sexual advances, is
raped, and enjoys the sexual encounter   (54, 189)  .
  This is a frequent theme in pornographic videos but in
milder form it pervades the popular media.   Even when the
censor cuts a scene, it just leaves a gap where the rape ought
to be.   Men who watch this kind of material internalise the
message that women really want sex and enjoy being raped, even
though they may initially say no.   Such messages give men
permission to rape.   Implicit rape scenes give vulnerable
men as much (or more) permission as overt depiction.   The
message that women wish to be violated to fulfil their sexual
desires must be banished for ever from popular culture.  
    Some minor changes to the law and improvement in
judicial practice have lessened the ordeal of the victim.
  Rape crisis centres provide support for both recent
victims, and those who were raped in the past and who have
long carried a secret burden.   Victim impact assessment is
now routine so that the court will have adequate evaluation of
the damage which has occurred.  
    A substantial study of rape victims was included in
the Department of Justice 's Rape Study in 1983.   In the
first volume, Warren Young discussed the law, court, and
judicial proceedings relating to rape   (259)  .
  While much can be done to protect the victim from the
distressing experience of legal proceedings, the basic problem
is the reluctance of victims to report at all.   Young
believed that changes in the law and practice would encourage
a higher level of reporting, but he acknowledged that rape
puts the victim in such an invidious social position that
legal changes are unlikely to have much effect.   Rather, he
put his trust in community education and the establishment of
comprehensive, readily available, and adequate victim support
services.  
    The victim must be given every protection from public
exposure, yet the public must be informed when rape has
occurred, and by whom.   It is almost impossible to punish
the perpetrator without further punishing the victim.   The
characteristics of rapists are so diverse that it is likewise
almost impossible to run educational and publicity campaigns
which do not deepen women 's mistrust of men in general.   It
is regrettable that half of the population must distrust the
other half because of the actions of a few.   This seems
unfair, and many worthy men may feel grossly offended.   It
is ironic that it is the non-rapist who must establish his
credentials.   But all men are capable of rape, and those
who reject that possibility are simply distancing themselves
from a major social problem caused by their own gender.
  This is not a cause which women must fight alone.  
    The second volume of the Department of Justice 's
report consisted of research studies.   The first described
an in-depth interview study of fifty women rape victims, four
of whom had been raped twice   (236)  .   The sample
was small and adventitious rather than systematic, and was
used by the authors largely to illustrate various topics and
themes, such as why some women report rape and some women do
not, the circumstances under which rape occurs, the
experiences which victims report of police procedures, and the
court process.   These fifty women also commented on the
sources and quality of support or help that they received.
  There is a special section on rape within marriage.  
    The recommendations from this study (and there were a
great many) were wide ranging.   This is understandable,
because the area of rape, as social policy, is deeply
perplexing.   The injury inflicted not only by the attack
but also by subsequent legal proceedings (if the rape is
reported at all) persists in memory and may deepen rather than
be resolved by time.   Because of this, we will never know
how many rapists go uncaught and unchallenged, or how much
damage they do to their victims.  
    The recommendations in the study emphasise that the
existence of rape must be frankly acknowledged and publicly
discussed.   They urge that the police employ women officers
and that only they should deal with the victim and in
circumstances that are more sensitive to the special nature of
sexual assault.   They call for judicial proceedings to be
reoriented and restructured to take account of the victim 's
special needs, and for support services to be universally
available and publicly funded.  
    The Justice Department Rape Study also contained a
report on rape complaints which revealed that most rape
complainants know the name of the rapist   (231)  .
  Even in gang rapes (one in five of all complaints) at
least one member of the gang was known to the victim.
  Contrary to popular belief, rapists do not often inflict
serious physical injury on the victim, but usually use force
such as grabbing and pushing and threats of physical injury or
injury to the woman 's reputation.  
    The information in this report is distressingly
familiar.   From the police records, there would appear to
be two kinds of rape.   In one, the victim is likely to be
young, unemployed, and attacked in a public place by a
stranger or someone she knows by name but only casually.
  The other, more frequent rape is by someone acquainted
with the victim.   The former feature more frequently in the
police records while the latter, overwhelmingly, predominate
in the records of rape crisis centres and support groups,
which show that rape victims cover a wide range of ages and
are most likely to be raped in their own home by someone they
know.  
    The complaint data show that the majority of
defendants (64 per cent) plead guilty.   In the year of the
study, there were twenty-seven rape defendants who proceeded
to a jury trial&semi; of these, thirteen were convicted of rape or
attempted rape.   The defence usually turns on one of two
issues: the allegation that consent was given and therefore
there was no rape, or that the accused was misidentified
  (231)  .  
    The police, it seems, loathe the whole business.
  They generally despise the rapists and have an embarrassed
but quite genuine desire to lessen the unpleasant nature of
the experience for the complainant.   The frequent
absence of any corroborative evidence makes this and child
sexual abuse peculiar issues in terms of court procedures.  
    These studies preceded the general legislative review
of 1986 when the definition of rape was changed to that of
sexual violation, a husband 's exemption from the charge of
rape was withdrawn, and a woman 's past sexual history could be
referred to only with the explicit permission of the presiding
judge.   Strengthening the role of rape crisis centres and
women 's refuges is clearly part of government intention, but
so far funding is still very limited.  
    Anti-rape education remains still at the discretion of
schools.   Despite the worthy efforts of voluntary groups,
we are still a long way from rearing a generation of men for
whom rape is an unthinkable act.   And for all progress that
we make, there is an unknown degree of counteraction caused by
the depiction of rape, near rape, or what might have been
rape, in videos, movies, and television.  
    In their submission to the Roper Committee of Inquiry
into Violence the police collected information on 100
prisoners convicted of rape and found a high correlation
between rape and general offending   (150)  .
  These 100 may be the worst the police could find&semi; their
rate of offending was an appalling average of 24.7 convictions
each.   Forty-three of this group were Pakeha, fifty-seven
were Polynesian, and twenty-six belonged to gangs most of
which were Maori.   Gang members committed an average of
30.7 offences each.   The police conclude that greater
police pressure will have to be placed on gang members, even
though such pressure would almost certainly increase
offending.   While much attention is given to the more lurid
incidents of gang rape, indecent assaults and individual rapes
by gang members, it is necessary to keep the issue of gang
membership in perspective.   Total gang membership
throughout the country is around 4,000, a rise from just over
2,000 in 1986.  
    The aim of gangs is not to wage war on society, even
though one might well gain that impression from the media.
  The major purpose of gangs is to provide affiliation and
support for their members.   They are a substitute for
family for individuals whose own families are unsatisfactory,
unsupportive, or simply non-existent.   Many gang members
already have extensive police records before they joined.
  The police submission to the ministerial inquiry into
violence gives powerful evidence of the disastrous background
factors in the lives of these multiple offenders, whose
records often begin in their early teens, probably after some
years of living outside parental control and supervision.
  Since no one cared, they may have grown up beyond moral
and social constraint, and feel they owe nothing to a society
that gave them nothing.   The gang may be their first
positive humanising social experience.   We need to remember
that gangs are not violent most of the time, and that the
violence arises for structural reasons and in critical
incidents.  
    The media tend to concentrate on the violent
activities of some gangs or gang members as though membership
is the cause of offending   (108)  .   Many of these
individuals would have pursued these kinds of activities
whether or not they were members of gangs.   All multiple
rape is not committed by gangs.   It occurred throughout
history long before modern gangs emerged.   It is a sad fact
of bad male behaviour in groups.   But there is no doubt
that the members of one particular gang have been associated
with homicide and severe brutalities in the past and also with
stand-over tactics to intimidate witnesses.   Many gang
houses maintain an arsenal of weapons of various kinds,
chiefly in order to defend themselves against other gangs.
  The endeavours of the Labour Department through the
contract work scheme and the employment of streetworkers
specifically to deal with group employment has gone a long way
to converting some of the gangs into skilled business
operators.   In some of these programmes examination has
revealed evidence of featherbedding, contract inflation, the
making use of every possible loophole and the taking advantage
of poor supervision, but nothing specifically criminal has
been revealed and that is not the general situation.  
      Gangs are frequently led by individuals with
plenty of intelligence but little formal education, who have a
sharp-edged underdog 's view of society and are perfectly
capable of finding dodgy ways of taking advantage of whatever
the system allows.   Techniques of intimidating government
grant officers are not novel.   Tom Wolfe vividly described
similar methods for obtaining funds from grant officers under
Lyndon Johnson 's 'great society' programme.   American
society learnt years ago that gangs develop respect for a
streetworker who is similar enough to themselves to be
able to work with them, to call their bluff and to direct them
away from socially disruptive and ultimately self-destructive
activity   (256)  .  
    Currently we have only the rudiments of such a
service, no effective training technique for group and
community workers, and therefore no way of offering
alternatives to the effective recruitment practices which
gangs operate both inside and outside the prison system.
  There is no doubt that gangs use the prison system to put
their own recruitment officers inside and to offer a more
effective bridge than the probation service for released
prisoners.   Your gang is more than your family&semi; it will
find you a lawyer if you are in trouble, give you money if you
need it, provide for your entertainment, accommodation, even
work should you want it.   The surprising thing is that
membership is only a few thousands.   It is equally
surprising that we have not learnt from the very techniques
that gangs employ, how better to provide for those who are
attracted to them.  
    For example, in some areas gangs have asked Maori
communities for permission to build gang premises on
papakainga (tribal land).   In the cases of which we are
aware, the kaumatua have not considered the marae to be the
best place for gang living.   There are thousands of
hectares of tough country where the challenge of living
communally and recreating the myth of a tribal past might be
made to work and some have tried.   But gangs are a product
of urban life-style, the wage economy and the dole or other
loose money in the system for those who would take advantage
of it.   Living rough in rural settings needs quite a
different set of survival skills.   If rural alternative
life-styles are an answer someone will have to show how new
skills will be learned and how people will be motivated to
acquire them.      
  

          2.2 Legislating for Outcomes      
    Government policies in support of unions may be seen
as having two primary objectives.   One is the creation of
 'democracy' in the workplace, whether this is seen as a means
of eventually breaking down capitalism, or as a means of
combatting the supposedly dehumanizing practices of
capitalism.   It is an objective of politicizing an economic
relationship.  
    The second objective is to assure certain outcomes for
workers in terms of remuneration and work conditions, by
countering the 'bargaining power' of the employer (or
employers as a class) with the 'bargaining power' of a
monopolistic union.   By conferring a degree of monopoly
power on unions by statute, the government effectively
delegates to unions its own power to  'set' outcomes in labour
market relationships&semi; unions, rather than the government or
its bureaucracies, are seen as the   'rational'  ,
  'articulate'   and   'wise'  
replacement for the   'uncontrolled'   processes
of the market.  
    The alternative, of course, is to legislate directly
for these outcomes.   And in practice, even where the powers
conferred on unions are extensive, as in New Zealand,
governments do take on a substantial role in attempting to set
pay and work conditions directly.   This role would seem to
indicate at least an implicit acceptance that unions are in
fact not a very good way of protecting the most vulnerable
members of the workforce&semi; their   forte   lies rather in
bolstering the position of the middling strong.   This is
made explicit in Dickman 's description of the agenda of union
leaders in the United States earlier this century - an agenda
combining support for pro-union legislation (syndicalism) and
direct intervention in outcomes (statism):
        For the unorganized and what they saw
as the unorganizable classes of labor (women and children),
many trade union leaders favored laws that would either
directly fix wage contracts (minimum wages) or remove the
contractors from the market entirely (abolition of child
labor, immigration restriction).   But for organized or
easily organizable workers, their agenda was more syndicalist
and less statist - an approach which one scholar has aptly
summarized in another context as a policy of having the
government become 'the ally of the labor organizations against
the employer, supplying the power' to override individual
rights, but 'not dictating to what ends it shall be
used'.     (1987, pp. 224-5)    
    Similarly in New Zealand legislated minimum conditions
are seen as underpinning the award system, and becoming more
significant with any weakening of that system:
        A national Minimum Wage, set at a
realistic level, would underpin the award system.   It would
provide a level below which awards could not fall and a moral
incentive for the parties to award negotiations to settle
above the statutory minimum.     (Brosnan and
Wilkinson, 1989, p. 16)    
    Union support for direct intervention to fix outcomes
for the 'unorganizable' was and is not, of course, a matter of
pure altruism.   Intervention to set a floor on wages or
conditions reduces the ability of workers outside unions to
compete with union members for jobs, for example, by providing
an incentive for employers to change the nature of production
or their entire business to substitute workers outside a
unionized occupational category for workers inside that
category.   Thus wage restrictions in South Africa have been
an important means of protecting white workers from
competition by blacks.  8     Intervention to limit
market entry altogether is an even more sure way of limiting
competition and bolstering union power.   This was arguably
a motive behind the Factory Acts in England (that limited the
employment of women at a time when factory conditions were
becoming less, not more, arduous),  9   and behind shop
trading hours legislation in New Zealand.  10   
  More recently, it has surfaced as an explanation of the
support given by relatively wealthy members of the European
Community to harmonization of labour legislation covering
everything from codetermination to comparable worth:
        In some member-states ... an argument
has surfaced and received a good deal of sympathy that without
a strong social action programme the wealthier countries in
the Community will suffer from social dumping, namely, that
Greece, Spain and Portugal, and in the future possibly Turkey,
which have lower labour and social costs, will enjoy an
advantage under the [Single European Act].   In other words,
unless the comparative cost advantages of these countries are
harmonised by a common level of social costs they will gain at
the expense of the more industrially advanced countries.
  This is a classic protectionist argument ....    
(Roberts, 1989, p. 45)    
    On the other hand, the extension of government
involvement in legislating for outcomes also serves to weaken
the case for supporting collective bargaining in an era in
which the notion of a fundamental capital-labour struggle -
and hence the 'need' to politicize the employment relationship
- is losing its edge.   As unions are increasingly justified
in terms of the economic benefits that they can win for
workers, their position could be argued to be weakened by
direct legislation for such 'benefits'.   The regulations
that they have nurtured have, by their coverage of workers
irrespective of union membership, reduced the incentives for
membership, and thus the dominance of collective
bargaining.  
    There has been a strong belief within the union
movement in New Zealand that there are certain things that
should not be negotiable, regardless of the power of unions to
negotiate for them.   These take on the character of
'inalienable' rights of workers, unionized or non-unionized,
and they range widely.   There is a 'right' to a forty-hour
week, a 'right' to strike and a (more ambiguous) 'right'
against 'unjust' dismissal, for example.   Similarly there
is a notion that occupational health and safety should not
even be seen as an 'industrial' issue (that is, as an integral
part of the employment relationship), and that related work
conditions should be non-negotiable.  
    Minimum wage law is perhaps the most significant means
of directly regulating the outcomes of employment
relationships.   New Zealand has had a statutory minimum
wage since 1942, introduced to 'protect' the wages of workers
directed to essential industries because of wartime
conditions.   A Minimum Wages Act was passed in 1945.
  Since 1948 it has not been necessary to amend the Act to
adjust the minimum upwards&semi; this is achieved instead by an
Order-in-Council.   The relative value of the minimum wage
has fluctuated considerably over time.   In 1948 it was 78%
of the average wage.   It fell below 60% in the mid-1960s,
and below 40% by the beginning of the 1980s.   When the
Labour Government came to power in 1984 it was 30% of the
average wage ($84.17 per week), but it was subsequently
adjusted upwards to 53% of the average wage ($210 per week) in
1987.   Increased again in dollar terms at the beginning of
1988 (to $225 per week, or 51% of the average wage), it was
effectively higher than the minima established in 20% of
awards then prevailing.  11    
    It is not uncommon for an economic gloss to be put on
the 'case' for a minimum wage.   For example, Brosnan and
Wilkinson in their defence of minimum wages in New Zealand
argue that:
        Besides the effect on living
standards, cheap labour brings with it a clear cost in
economic terms.   Within the workplace, it is a cause of low
morale, poorer standards and higher labour turnover.   At
the level of the individual firm, reliance on low pay as a
competitive strategy reduces the incentive to innovate and
invest.   At the industry and sector level, low wage
competition produces uncertainty for individual firms,
destabilises the business environment and hinders economic
growth.   At the macroeconomic level, low pay also results
in reduced demand for goods and services.   Finally, from
the taxpayer 's point of view, low pay increases dependence on
social security, resulting in higher levels of public
expenditure.     (1989, pp. 91-2)    
    The justifiability of this reasoning is considered in
the following chapter.  
    A wide range of regulations other than the minimum
wage affect the conditions of employment and the cost of
employing labour.   The eight-hour day/forty-hour week,
statutory vacation requirements, requirements for
maternity/paternity leave, occupational health and safety
regulations, accident compensation levies and industry
training levies all determine the condition under which an
employee can be taken on, and the cost of employing him or
her.   They make voluntary agreements to do things
differently, where this is the interest of both employer and
worker, impermissible - the implication being that society
knows better.  
    Another range of interventions similarly affecting the
nature of employment relationships involves those dictating
how the relationship between employer and worker can be
conducted (as opposed to specifying minimum conditions
directly).   Into this category fall such interventions as
legislation against discrimination on the basis of sex, race
or disability where this is irrelevant to the job.   It also
includes legislation on the conditions under which an employee
can be dismissed - legislation against 'unjust' dismissal,
redundancy requirements or plant closure laws - each of which
indirectly raises the costs associated with employment, and
the incentives for job creation.  
    The emphasis here can extend beyond outcomes to
defining permissible procedures - further 'usurping' the role
of unions and legislation establishing bargaining procedures
in unionized firms or occupations.   This is increasingly
being reinforced in judicial practice in New Zealand and
overseas, as the courts tend towards a  'substantive' approach
to justice, for example, looking beyond formal contracts in an
attempt to discover whether they are the outcome of  'real'
bargaining processes.  12      
        2.3 Recent Initiatives      
    Since the passage of the Labour Relations Act in 1987,
there have been a number of significant policy issues raised
in the area of labour market regulation.   These include the
reform of labour relations in the state sector, the
establishment of a state- and employer-funded Trade Union
Education Authority, proposals for 'employment equity'
(affirmative action and comparable worth) and 'industrial
democracy' legislation, a proposal to bring some independent
contractors under the Labour Relations Act, proposals for
levying employers to support training, proposals for the
reform of shop trading hours and occupational health and
safety regulations, as well as attempts to establish a
'Compact' between unions and the government with a view to a
more co-ordinated union influence not only in labour market
issues but in general policy formation.  
    The state sector reforms were particularly significant
in that they represented a far greater shift away from the
traditional system of labour market regulation than the
reforms contained in the Labour Relations Act.   In other
cases, most notably the 'employment equity', independent
contractors and 'industrial democracy' proposals and
negotiations towards a 'Compact', the tendency has been
towards a more collectivist approach&semi; a reinforcement of the
traditional system and the ideology underpinning it.   This
reflects a view that more reliance on voluntary exchange -
'the market' - in other areas of economic activity, rather
than increasing the pressures on employers to upgrade their
employment relationships, has rendered workers   more  
vulnerable.   Thus the Royal Commission on Social Policy in
1988 (apparently labouring under the misapprehension that
'freedom' in labour markets is all about driving wages
downwards) reported, with approval, that:
        The free market model is argued by
some as not being appropriate for New Zealand conditions.
  That model is argued to be based on 'Western European
values of freedom and individual rights and a belief that
active pursuit of these will result in the greatest good for
all' ... [it is argued that] this approach is monocultural,
taking no account of collective values, ignoring existing
structural inequalities, and creating greater inequalities.
  Similarly ... the free market ethic [is viewed] as
resulting in a society 'which serves the needs of those who
command power and financial resources: in New Zealand this
group is predominantly white, middle class, middle aged,
able-bodied and male'.   The Commission is broadly in
agreement with these criticisms.     (1988, p.
512)    
    Late nineteenth century concerns with 'bargaining
power' and exploitation, and a belief in the comforts of
coerced (as opposed to voluntary) collective responses, are
clearly alive and well in late twentieth century New
Zealand.  
        Independent Contractors and the Labour
Relations Act      
    In 1988 a Committee of Inquiry was established to
consider whether independent contractors who were
 'substantially dependent' on a single firm should be brought
within the jurisdiction of the Labour Relations Act.   While
this matter remains unresolved, it is an important one, in
that it turns on the fundamental differences between the law
applying to employment relationships and the remainder of
commercial law in New Zealand.   A contractor who is deemed
'independent' is free to structure his or her relationship
with a firm on his or her own account and in accordance with
his or her own interests&semi; within the broad constraints of
commercial law, the voluntary exchange principles of the
market apply.   if, on the other hand, that contractor is
deemed to be an 'employee', for example, on account of a heavy
reliance on a single firm for contracts, the conduct of that
relationship would become the prerogative of a union.  
    From one perspective, this can be seen as an argument
about 'exploitability'.   If the employment relationship is
regarded as   fundamentally   exploitative, it is not
surprising that the relationship between a small contractor
and a large company will similarly be regarded as
exploitative.   If the power of the union to exploit the
employee is ignored, so too will be the power of the union to
exploit a contractor.  
    In essence, however, it is an argument about
territory.   Independent contracts have been used
increasingly by employers and workers alike to avoid the
constraints imposed by a centralized system of collective
bargaining, presumably because it is in the interests of both
to do so.   The drive by the central union hierarchy to have
these contracts relabelled as  'dependent contracts' (Knox,
1986, p. 24) was in this sense primarily a move in defense of
the award system, at a time when increased pressures on
individual firms to improve their international
competitiveness were raising important questions about the
compatibility of this system with their survival and the
security of employment.   (In this regard, the increasing
importance of independent contractors in New Zealand is
matched by the rise of self-employment in the United Kingdom.
  Mather (1987) reports increases in self-employment between
1979 and 1987 ranging from 24% in the worst-performing region,
where paid employment fell by 17%, to 78% in the
best.)  
        'Employment Equity'      
    New Zealand has had equal pay legislation since 1972,
and anti-discrimination legislation (in the form of the Human
Rights Commission Act) since 1977.   The essential concern
of these two pieces of legislation is with fair treatment in
employment relationships.   In 1988, the Working Party on
Equal Employment Opportunities and Equal Pay put forward
proposals for 'employment equity' legislation, combining
target-based equal opportunities and comparable worth
(  'equal pay for work of equal value'  )
legislation (Wilson, 1988).   The emphasis here is not on
equality of treatment, but equality of outcomes (or
'intrinsically just' relativities).  
    An Employment Equity Bill, providing for mandatory,
results-oriented equal employment opportunities programmes
(that is, affirmative action) and comparable worth, was
introduced late in 1989.   This was despite widespread
opposition from the business community and from government
officials concerned about incongruities between the Bill and
at least the announced intentions of the Labour Relations Act,
and about the likely costs of comparable worth, both fiscally
and in terms of unemployment.   The government, however,
regarded itself as having made a strong electoral commitment
to the policy, and the Bill was passed into law in July
1990.  
    The key assumptions underlying the Act are familiar
ones: the concentration of women in a limited range of
occupations and a gap between the average wages of women and
men are seen as reflecting discrimination&semi; discrimination is
seen as inherent in market relationships (according to some,
markets are little more than a tool of white male oppression),
and the only means of countering this  'discrimination' is
thought to be the creation of a rational, wise and caring
'gender-neutral' bureaucracy, charged not with uncovering and
penalizing discriminatory behaviour, but with promoting equal
outcomes, whether in paid rates or in the distribution of
women and cultural minorities across jobs and job
hierarchies.  
    The 'employment equity' proposals increase in
significance once they are placed in the broader context of a
strongly collectivist labour relations system.   This system
already serves to equalize wages and conditions across broad
categories of workers and establish fairly rigid relativities
between categories.   Notions of 'just price' and comparable
worth are in a sense already strongly enshrined in this
system, and 'the market' is already substantially squeezed
out.   In so far as discrimination is a problem, it must
therefore be seen as enshrined not in the market but in the
system that has sought to replace it.  
    The Employment Equity Act provides for these policies
to be implemented by an 'Employment Equity Commissioner',
given extensive powers both to set and to enforce policy,
allowed considerable information-gathering and entry rights,
and subject to minimal appeal rights.   The resulting
combination of virtually unlimited power over employers and
workers with very limited accountability is noticeably at odds
with attempts in other areas of government activity to
separate policy advice from policy implementation, and to
increase bureaucratic accountability.  
    The part of the Act dealing with 'equal employment
opportunities' is highly prescriptive.   Detailed programmes
are required for a wide range of  'designated groups' - women,
M&amacron;ori, Pacific Islanders, workers with physical
or mental disabilities, and any other group of workers that
the Commissioner might decide to designate.   (It could be
assumed that some means would be found of excluding white,
able-bodied men from these designations.) The Commissioner is
also given the right to set minimum standards for programmes
(including for the required 'targets'), and to require
amendments to programmes, both when they are first being
prepared and after they have been in force for two or more
years - without any right of appeal.  
    The part of the Act concerned with comparable worth
(under the misnomer 'pay equity') is even more cumbersome and
reliant on bureaucratic intervention.   One notable feature
is the effective exclusion of women not represented by a union
or represented by a union unwilling to take a comparable worth
claim, as claims could only be implemented through the
existing award system.   Another is the minimal provision
for recognition of 'economic factors' in assessing and
implementing claims.   A third is the direct conflict
between some provisions of this Act and the Labour Relations
Act.   In particular, comparable worth claims will be based
on paid, not award rates, thus reintroducing a form of the
second-tier bargaining which was removed by the Labour
Relations Act.   Further, the Act provides access to
compulsory final offer arbitration for the settling of
comparable worth claims, a move that is in conflict with the
removal of compulsory arbitration in 1984.  
    Overall, the Employment Equity Act represents a
significant reversal on at least the rhetoric which
accompanied the Labour Relations Act.   It can be expected
to reinforce the centralization of wage determination and the
preoccupation with relativities that have long characterized
labour relations in New Zealand.  
        'Industrial Democracy' and the
'Compact'      
    In 1989, a Committee of Inquiry was established to
consider legislation for   'industrial
democracy'  , which was defined as    'meaningful
participation'   by workers in the decisions affecting
their working lives, at the workplace, enterprise, industry
and national level.   This task was subject to widely
varying interpretations, and was only partly limited by the
requirement that such legislation should be consistent with
the intentions of the Labour Relations Act.   But one
important motivation appears to have been an interest in the
applicability of the 'corporativist' models of Germany,
Austria and the Scandinavian countries to the New Zealand
labour market system, with 'codetermination' at the company
level, industry-wide planning, and participation of union
officials in economic planning at a national level - an
interpretation that has been adopted with some enthusiasm by
the Council of Trade Unions (Douglas, 1989).  
    'Codetermination' would represent a significant
development in shifting decision-making power away from
shareholders and the managers who represent them, and thus
away from those individuals who bear the key risks associated
with a company 's activities.   It is a logical extension of
the argument that the 'bargaining weakness' of workers can
only be overcome by the politicization of the employment
relationship - and ultimately a grasping by 'labour' of the
decision-making prerogatives of 'capital'.   A similar
notion is at work in negotiations towards a 'Compact' between
the Council of Trade Unions and the government
(  employers'   organizations having declined to
participate).  
    The report of the Committee of Inquiry was released
late in 1989.   It recommends highly prescriptive
legislation for participatory councils to be established
within enterprises, a move towards more industry-level
consultation, and an expansion of national tripartite
initiatives.  
    The Committee 's report reinforces the concerns about
the direction of labour market policy which were created by
the likes of the 'employment equity' initiatives.   It is a
strange mixture of assertions of pragmatism and rather crude
pseudo-Marxist ideology, of logical inconsistency and confused
empirical reference.   It illustrates the conviction that
competition in the labour market is between employers and
workers.   And its recommendations are both highly
prescriptive and biased in favour of reinforcing the position
of the existing union hierarchy.   The one strong impression
that it creates is of a will to legislate, contrary to the
Committee 's own asserted preference for voluntary solutions.
  Indeed, the Committee 's approach was nicely summarized in
its own assertion that:     'Our approach is
pragmatic.   We do not intend to embark on philosophic,
academic or broadly principled analyses.'     (Horn
  et al  ., 1989, p. 26)  
        State Sector Reforms      
    The state sector in New Zealand accounts for around
25% of the work-force.   The system of collective bargaining
that applies to this work-force has from the beginning
differed fundamentally from that operating in the private
sector.   In particular, registration has not been required
for unions to be recognized and the awards they negotiate to
be legally binding.   In some instances union membership is
voluntary, including in the Public Service Association which
is the dominant representative of state employees.  
    On the other hand, wages and conditions in the state
sector have tended to be more susceptible to direct
intervention than those prevailing in the private sector.
  This in part reflects the practice of setting wages by
reference to a set of relativities with the private sector and
within the public sector where comparable jobs cannot be found
in the private sector.   But the practice is reinforced by
the notion that public sector pay, conditions and practices
should set an example for the private sector, for example,
with regard to equal pay and the rights of women and
minorities.  
      The activities of government departments were
subjected to increased competition with the move to
corporatize their trading activities through the formation of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs).   This in turn created a
need for greater flexibility in employment contracts.
  Provisions to enable collective bargaining on an
enterprise basis were included in the SOE legislation which
came into effect in April 1987.  
    A concern to reform 'core' (non-trading) government
activities similarly brought renewed attention to public
sector labour relations, and to proposals to change state
sector pay-fixing mechanisms.   The State Sector Act passed
in 1988 sought to reduce disparities between the private and
state sectors, for example, applying union registration
requirements to state unions, and abolishing the special
appeals procedures.   It also introduced fundamental changes
in personnel arrangements&semi; heads of departments were replaced
with chief executives appointed (with a Ministerial right of
veto) for a maximum of five years, who were to be responsible
for all other appointments within their departments.
  Automatic wage adjustments applying across the state
sector were abolished.  
    The flexibility of arrangements now possible in the
state sector is notably greater than in the private sector.
  There have been important moves in the direction of
enterprise bargaining, both in the SOEs and through a move
(advocated by the Public Service Association) to
department-by-department agreements.   The parameters of
union coverage have also become negotiable, so that there are
effectively no legislative constraints on the nature of
representation.  
    The result is a system which is more responsive to
worker and employer needs than the private sector system under
the Labour Relations Act.   However, it remains in essence a
similar system.   It takes its justification from the same
sorts of concerns about the potential for exploitation of
workers by a powerful employer (the government manifesting a
profound distrust of its own bureaucracies in matters of
employment policy), and it answers these concerns with the
same policy prescription: collective bargaining and 'good
employer' requirements that shape both the contents of
employment contracts and the processes that determine
employment relations.      
  

    3.     MILITARY WIVES      
    Finch argues that the content of   husbands'  
work and the way it is organised determine the extent to which
a wife will be incorporated and the form that a wife 's
incorporation will take.  
    Traditionally, the military has preferred to recruit
single men and has imposed barriers to marriage.   These
barriers stem from the military 's insistence that priority is
given to the military role - the military must come first.
  Other close bonds   "such as marriage involve
potential conflicts of loyalties, and so may impinge on the
military 's ability to carry out its task"  . (Smith
(Ed.) 1982: 15)   Historically, women featured on the
fringes of military life as camp followers accompanying the
troops.   Even in the late 19th century the position of
military wives was precarious as they were   "not rated
except as camp followers over whom the commanding officer has
complete control"  . (Findlayson in McCubbin   et
al   (Eds.), 1976: 21)  
    Although modern military forces have a higher
proportion of married personnel, they have retained a career
structure based on the single male which is symbolized in the
phrase:   "if the army had wanted you to have a wife it
would have issued you one"  . (Kohen, 1984:
403)  2    
    The military is almost unique in the constellation of
demands it places on its members.   The most salient aspect
of a military career is an unlimited commitment&semi; no part of
the day or night, nor the service person 's life itself, is
exempt from the legitimate demands of the military.  
    This paper now explores the way in which, and the
extent to which, men 's military careers structure the lives of
their wives.   It does so by looking at military careers in
terms of their temporal aspects, spatial aspects and work
characteristics.   This is followed by an exploration of the
contributions which military wives make to their
  husbands'   careers by providing employers with "two for
the price of one" and providing their husbands with moral
support.  
    A.  HOW MEN'S WORK STRUCTURES   WIVES'  
LIVES    
    i. Temporal Aspects  
    One of the dominant characteristics of this unlimited
commitment is its temporal variability.   A service member
may work from 5am to 10pm or be home for days at a time -
  "what may be the most regular about military duty is
its irregularity"   (Kohen, 1984: 404).   A further
component of the temporal aspect of military life is that of
periodic separations of the service member from the rest of
his family.   The length of separations varies from a few
days to a year.  3    
    Both of these temporal aspects of military work have
implications for military wives.   Firstly, the irregularity
of military work disrupts plans and affects the making of
plans as shown in the following comments by two army wives:
      "  They 'd been away over a week, and we
was looking forward to having them here for a week or two...
we 'd all got plans made for the weekend... And then... less
than forty-eight hours later they 're on stand by, then within
twelve hours of that away they go... Everybody was bloody
furious about it."     (Quoted in Parker, 1985: 240)
  "It 's the going away, coming back, going
away: a few days, a few weeks, you can't ever plan anything
satisfactory."  
  (Quoted in Parker, 1985: 263)      
    The irregular hours and separations put strains and
stresses on military wives.   The loneliness which wives
suffer (especially younger wives) at being separated from
their husbands is compounded by the practice of geographic
mobility which usually separates wives from the support of
parents and old friends.  
    Older wives are   "thrust into the role of sole
parent"   (Segal, 1986: 20), which restricts their
leisure time and employment opportunities.   One airforce
wife expresses her situation in the following way:
      "  I resent the fact that my decisions
about my choices in life are coloured by my husband 's job.
  I feel that I have to compensate for my husband 's
irregular hours and absences and be ever available to fill any
father role gaps for the children 's sake."  
  (Quoted in Jans in Smith (Ed.), 1985: 70)      
    The lack of support from an extended family, the
unpredictability of the husband 's absences and the long hours
worked restrict the wife 's employment options in another way:
They close off the option of arranging to work complementary
shifts.  
    Further, the prolonged separations create an ambiguous
social situation for the military wife.   She is neither a
single parent nor a married parent.   This ambiguity can
create difficulties in her social relationships with civilians
and therefore pressures her to turn to the military community
for friendships.  
    ii. Spatial Aspects  
    (a) Mobility  
    Another aspect of "unlimited commitment" which adds to
family disruption is   "the military prerogative to
decide where the service member will live and the length of
stay"  . (Kohen, 1984: 404)  
    Military personnel experience a higher rate of
geographical mobility than almost any other group in
society.  4     While mobility is not unique, the
military family moves for different reasons than civilians.
  Civilian employees have a choice, including turning down a
promotion or changing jobs rather than moving.   However, as
Eril Deighton (a former President of the Army Wives
Association) points out, military families move often and not
out of choice,   "not to a place we want to live in, not
always on promotion, not to a home we would like to live in
and often not with sufficient notification of the
move"  .     (Quoted in Smith, 1982: 1)  
    The effects of high mobility are different for the
husband than the wife.   The husband 's career is generally
enhanced by mobility, whereas his wife 's career is generally
undermined.  
    A number of studies indicate that the frequency and
uncertainty of postings of their husbands place many military
wives at a labour market disadvantage.  5     High
mobility means frequent breaks in the military wife 's
employment or education and training.   This discontinuity
limits opportunities for career development or for accruing
such benefits as long service and sick leave or
superannuation.   Wives may also be located in service
establishments in areas where employment opportunities are
limited&semi; they may have to search for jobs in unfamiliar
geographic areas (where they have no contacts to facilitate
their employment)&semi; they may experience difficulties
transferring their qualifications from one place to another
and may also experience some job discrimination as some
employers   "are reluctant to employ people they know
will be moving in a couple of years"  . (Hamilton, 1986:
41)   Moreover, the concomitant lack of experience, training
and seniority may result in lower earnings for military
wives.  
    The military wife 's employment position reduces the
possibility for a second income for the military family.
  Consequently, there are a number of "reluctant" one-income
families or precarious two-income families, which are unable
to enter into financial commitments that depend on a second
income because of the ever present possibility that the second
income will be lost on posting.   Paid work is not only
valued for its economic rewards, it is also a source of
personal identity, personal worth and social relationships not
only for men but also increasingly for women.   Thus, the
unemployment and under-employment of military wives can cause
problems of personal identity and self worth and deprive them
  "of an important channel through which they can form
links with a new community and develop support networks for
themselves"  . (Hamilton, 1986: 42)  
    The husband 's job also constrains military
  wives'   education and re-education opportunities.
  The difficulties posed by living in remote areas and often
having full responsibility for child care are compounded by
their mobile lifestyle.   Postings often occur after the
close of enrolments for courses, so the first year of a
posting may be wasted in educational terms.   It is also
  "very difficult to complete courses without
interruptions by postings or to transfer to a different
educational institution without loss of credits"  .
(Hamilton, 1986: 50)  
    Social attachments help to make people the kind of
person they are, not only in other people 's eyes but also in
their own estimation.   Frequent moves (as well as
separations from their husbands) mean that military wives
experience frequent losses of social attachments in the normal
course of their lives.   Husbands have their jobs to give
them a considerable degree of continuity.  
    But the frequent losses of social attachments can
shake the military wife 's self confidence, damage her
self-esteem and create self-identity problems.   These
problems are compounded by the handicaps wives have trying to
make new attachments: their ambiguous "sole parent/married
parent" status, their responsibilities for child care, their
restricted employment opportunities, and the short time that
they are resident in any one area.  
    In her study of Australian Service families, Hamilton
(1986) found that after a period of five - ten years some
families feel that the effort of being a newcomer in yet
another community is too great, they   "stop trying to
make new friends and contacts and withdraw from community life
- in effect simply living out the time until the next posting
comes round"  . (Hamilton, 1986: 26)   Not only is
making new friends difficult but parting from friends can be
painful as one military wife comments after moving from a very
close friend:
      "The greatest tragedy (of moving) is
leaving your friends.   I really had problems after our last
move&semi; I have a very close friend in... and I suppose it took
me almost a year before I got over that.   I think one might
get to the stage of saying to yourself that 'I 'm not going to
get really close to people because of the painful goodbyes
we 'll have'.   Maybe you can't afford to need others too
much."  
  (Quoted in Jans in Smith (Ed.), 1985: 68)      
    The lack of continuity of health care is one further
aspect of mobility which has implications for military wives.
  Hamilton (1986) found that in the areas of gynaecological
and obstetric services many women felt deprived by being
unable to have a continuing relationship with a doctor they
knew and trusted.   Also they experienced further
difficulties when posted to remote areas.  
    (b) Tied Housing  
    In many postings there is no alternative accommodation
to living in military housing.   Although this offers
convenience to the husband in that he is close to work, it
minimises the wife 's freedom to choose accommodation and
produces problems of isolation as it distances her from
civilian jobs and services and reduces the prospects of mixing
with the civilian community.  
    Military houses are not only allocated but done so
basically according to rank.   Accommodation for military
personnel on military property is spatially separated by rank
in that there are areas set aside for different rank
groupings.   Further, the quality of the house tends to be
related to rank: the higher the rank the better the quality of
house.   As Macmillan points out,   "the ordinary
soldier will be accommodated in a flat, the NCO in a terraced
house, and the officer in one with three bedrooms and an
open-plan sitting-room on the model of the average council
house"  . (Macmillan, 1984: 102)   This has several
implications for military wives, e.g., wives are designated a
rank by the house they live in and by their neighbours and
hence, to a large extent, the people they socially relate with
are chosen by the military.  
    An Australian study (Jans, 1985) found that less than
half of the wives living in married quarters were satisfied
with their housing, and a quarter were clearly dissatisfied.
  There are several causes for this dissatisfaction,
including the low standard of housing, the poor standard of
maintenance, discrepancies in the fittings provided, and
inconsistency in the standard of houses.   These last two
points have consequences for the placement of furniture and
the adequacy of furnishings.   A further factor may
contribute to this dissatisfaction.   Ownership of and
residence in one 's own home is a cultural goal in most
contemporary Western societies.   Military families, because
of their high geographic mobility, are less likely than
civilian families to live in or own their own home.   Many
military wives are frustrated by this non-fulfilment of a
major cultural goal. (Hellyer in Smith (Ed.), 1987: 1)  
    The combination of tied accommodation and non home
ownership leaves the wife in a precarious position if the
marriage breaks up, as the military will house the husband
while the wife will be homeless.   Husbands can use this to
intimidate their wives:
      "He can always threaten you that he 'll
leave you and go back into barracks.   There 's no answer to
his question, 'And where 'll that leave you?'   You know
where, out on the street."  
  (Quoted in Parker, 1985: 272)      
    One further aspect of living in tied military
accommodation is that of the housing inspections which take
place when a family leaves a military house.   Many wives
find these inspections (marching out) a humiliating
experience, for   "although the serviceman is held
responsible in theory, in practice it is his wife who is
considered  'dirty' or  'slovenly'"  . (Jolly, 1987:
46)  
    The behaviour of all military personnel is subject to
military scrutiny.   The degree to which it conforms to
military expectations can affect the career of personnel.
  When living on military installations military personnel
are under more pressure to conform   "because they are
more subject to military control and attention"  .
(Segal, 1986: 23)   This also applies to their families.
  Violations of prescribed behaviour can not only have
repercussions in the workplace but also result in pressure on
the husband to control family members.  
    Living on a military base intensifies the
incorporation of the wife into a military way of life.   The
latter has clearly defined role obligations and benefits for
the wife, which are largely determined by her husband 's rank
and position.   Jolly (1987) notes that there is a growing
number of wives who criticise the effects that living on
military establishments has on personal identity.   The
undermining of individuality, the pressures to conform and the
extension of the rank structure to families are all part of
married patch life which one ex-military wife describes as
  "an oppressive, claustrophobic and anachronistic life
led by women who have no status other than that conferred on
them by their husband 's rank"  .   (Quoted in Jolly,
1987: 55)  
    In recent years the military, particularly on
large military establishments, has developed services which
ostensibly aim to assist military personnel and their families
in coping with the difficulties of military life.   However,
these services facilitate the military 's invasion of private
life as this wife 's comment illustrates:
        "The bloody Families Officers seem to
think they 're responsible for our morals while our husbands
are away.   They come round for a 'friendly' chat with you,
and you get the feeling they 're prying into your private
life."     (Quoted in Parker, 1985: 269)      
        iii. Work Characteristics    
      (a) Spilling Over    
    There is the ever present possibility that a military
husband will be subject to physical injury or death.
  Although this risk is greatest in wartime, even peacetime
military training exercises entail some risk of injury, and
military personnel can be sent at any time to areas of armed
conflict.   The possibility that her husband may be injured
or killed not only places an extra stress on the military wife
but can also be used by her husband and the military as a form
of emotional blackmail.   For example, the "don't have an
argument with your husband before he goes flying - you may
never see him again" message which wives of pilots are given.
  In peacetime, military personnel spend a lot of time
preparing for active duty by engaging in military training
exercises.   These exercises can be very demanding on
participants.   They are often conducted in adverse physical
conditions and can be stressful, emotionally draining and
physically exhausting.   After exercises, home becomes a
haven with implications for the wife:
        "When your husband comes back, if he has
been away on a hard exercise... he does not want to hear for
the first thing what a terrible time you have been having -   he
wants to come to a warm and loving home, so you have to be
able to put your own feelings in the background."  
  (Quoted in Parker, 1987: 62)      
    Leisure time is affected by the military job in
another way.   The military believes that a spirit of
comradeship, mutual trust and loyalty are essential in a
fighting force and therefore energetically promotes the
development of     esprit de corps    
on and off duty.   Consequently, male group activities such
as sporting events, "happy hours" and regular mess functions
are actively supported.   Furthermore, military personnel
are expected to attend at least some of these functions,
especially the major and more expensive ones.   The
military, therefore, demands and gets time, enthusiasm, energy
and money from personnel which some wives feel should be
directed to the family.   The exclusion of wives from many
of these activities serves to heighten their often felt
resentment of these activities which they see as a further
demonstration that their husband 's first loyalty is to the
military.   However, the     esprit de
corps     ethos is so strong that it   "can
make wives feel guilty and selfish if they seem to be
undermining it"  . (Jolly, 1987: 100)  
    (b) Setting Apart  
    The creation of military establishments, the different
lifestyle and, perhaps more importantly, the role of the
military and what it represents, sets the military apart from
the rest of the community.   Consequently, the military wife
may feel and experience isolation&semi; an isolation which is
increased by the civilian community 's inadequate understanding
of the demands of military life.   Further, the attitude of
the civilian community towards the military can vary from
admiration to outright hostility.   Hamilton found that
military wives exhibited a great lack of self-esteem which
seemed to reflect and   "perhaps exaggerate a perceived
hostility towards them by the civilian community"  .
(Hamilton, 1986: 27)      
  

        Chapter 2 The context of
discounting      
        2.1 Dynamic cost-benefit
analysis      
    Much of the unease directed at discounting is, in
fact, misdirected.   Rather the target should be its
context, dynamic cost-benefit analysis, or at a deeper level,
the underlying ethic of preference utilitarianism.  
    Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a framework for
comparing the pros and cons (in dollars) of a project.
  When costs are incurred and benefits gained at different
times, a dynamic cost-benefit model is used.   Discounting
is a weighting mechanism that enables costs and benefits that
occur at different times to be compared.  
    When a firm considers putting money into a project,
the future benefits (stream of profits) must be compared with
the costs (both upfront and ongoing).   The
  market   or   private   discount rate
used to do this is the interest rate.   To a firm, earlier
profits are more valuable than later profits since they can be
loaned at interest.  
    Individuals also employ discounting in every day
decision making, although most of us less formally than a firm
does in planning its cash flow.   Shall I buy now or save
and buy later?     Consumer   discount rates vary
enormously.  
    When the investment of public money is considered,
another type of discount rate is sometimes used - the
  social   or   public service   discount
rate.   (Whether these two are precisely the same for
natural resource development agencies reformed into State
Owned Enterprises is not clear.)  
    There are arguments from both ends of the spectrum
that social discounting is not valid&semi; one end maintains that
government should discount at the same rate as the private
sector, the other that discounting is not an appropriate
weighting mechanism for government to use.   In the middle
is the standard position that the social discount rate is
lower than the market discount rate.  
    There are two popular investment criteria in which the
discount rate plays a critical role.   The first involves
bringing all costs and benefits back to the present, thus
assessing the   net present value   (NPV).   A
positive NPV is a minimum indicator of "economic viability".
  The second criterion for acceptability is that the
expected average rate of return (the   internal rate of
return  , IRR) must be equal to the discount rate.
  These criteria are not different versions of the same rule
since they do not rank projects
consistently.    1        1  
      "It is now widely (but not yet widely enough)
realised that the present value criterion and the internal
rate of return criterion lead to accepting and rejecting the
same projects only if there are no budgetary limitations, if
projects do not preclude one another, and if streams of net
returns are first negative and then positive"    
(Stokey &amp; Zeckhauser, 1978, p.167).    
        2.2 What worries people about cost-benefit
analysis?      
    Some critics of cost-benefit analysis seem to believe
that high positive discount rates are an integral part of
CBA.    2        2     See
Pearce, 1985.     This is not so and it is
essential to distinguish problems with CBA from problems with
discounting.  
    What are the weaknesses of CBA? There are two common
criticisms that are not the fault of CBA   per se  , but
result from its misuse&semi; these two are that CBA provides a too
narrow basis for policy decisions and that there is potential
for   "  rule by experts  "   (Pearce, 1983,
p.2).  
    There are two major problems with CBA itself.   The
first is the problem of   valuation.     For
instance, in a CBA of a forestry investment, the future price
of timber must be predicted.   But there is a more
intractable valuation problem, namely the attempt to place
dollar values on goods and services that are not sold.   In
an environmental context:
        "  The problem lies in the
economic theory of value based upon the assumption that all
assets are either reproducible or substitutable e.g., swimming
pools for polluted beaches.   Thus, at least in principle,
permanent loss (non-reproducible) has zero value or has a
value of infinity - permitting, perhaps, the surrogate value
to be a function of the whim of the
calculator!  "     (Friend, 1979,
p.72).    
    The necessity of expressing everything in dollars has
been analogously (and colourfully) described as horse and
rabbit stew.   The rabbit is the small part that can
satisfactorily be represented in dollars, whereas the flavour
of the stew is dominated by the horse - the so-called
intangibles (Norton, 1984, p.88).   The horse is elusive.
        "  ... we have to know the shadow
price of environmental functions.   And in most cases this
cannot be found  "     (Hueting, 1987,
p.65).    
    The second major criticism of CBA is that those who
receive the benefits are not necessarily those who pay the
costs&semi; this is sometimes known as the   "divergence of
costs and benefits"   .   Cost-benefit analysis is a
relaxation of Pareto
optimality    3        3     An
outcome is Pareto optimal when no one is made worse off&semi; under
the present value criterion some people (or generations) can
be made worse off as long as benefits exceed costs
overall.  &semi; it does not matter where the costs and
benefits fall and so compensation need only remain potential
and not become actual (Page, 1977a, p.145).
        "...   trade-offs are all too easy
to make when the gain is ours and the cost is someone
else 's  "     (Pearce, 1977, p.360).    
    Thus, many see maximising the   present  
value of benefits minus costs (max. NPV) as
intergenerationally
unfair.    4        4     Page
comments on the present value criterion:       "To
an assembly of representatives drawn from all generations,
this criterion would not look much more attractive than the
scheme of vesting total ownership and management of the
  oceans'   fisheries to one country this year, to another
the next year, to another the following year would look to an
assembly of present-day countries"     (Page, 1977a,
p.200).    
    It is true that the use of the dollar as a numeraire
causes great problems (and, like any numeraire, always will),
and that CBA focuses on efficiency not equity.   But what is
CBA intended to achieve?   No one methodology gives all the
answers.
        "  ... cost-benefit analysis is
not a precise decision-making tool, but simply a means of
summarizing information on some aspects of social
welfare  "     (Kerr, 1987, p.9).    
    Cost-benefit analysis works best on the margin, that
is, when it is used to assess a project that is small relative
to the economy.  
    Both Kerr and Pearce express concern with the way in
which   "  an outmoded conception of
CBA  "   (Pearce, 1985, p.674) is set up as a straw
man.   In fact,   "  extended CBA  "  
(non-market valuation) is increasingly being used to make the
case for the preservation of wilderness (Porter, 1982).
  Pearce makes the point that environmental destruction in
practice often has nothing to do with CBA.
        "  ... forest clearance in the
Sahel or in Brazil, for example, has not been justified on CBA
grounds but on grounds of macroeconomic objectives which
reveal limited or non-existent understanding of the ecological
requirements for survival  "   (Pearce, 1985,
p.674).      
        Chapter 3 The mechanism of
discounting      
        3.1 The mathematics      
    How does a discount rate of, say, 10% decrease the
value of future costs and benefits relative to the present?
  Understanding the basic mathematics of discounting is
crucial since the strategic nature of the discount rate is an
outcome of the arithmetic of discounting.  
    Consider the most commonly used investment criterion,
that of maximising net present value.  
  formula  
    In calculating net   present   value,
benefits and costs must all be discounted back to the present.
  This is done using the following formula:
  formula    
    Thus, if a project yields a net value 15 years
from now of $1,000,000 and the real discount rate is 10%, then
the net present value is:
  formula    
    There are two consequences of the mathematics of
discounting that cause unease.   The first is the
sensitivity of economic viability to the size of the discount
rate&semi; the second is that over generational time, future costs
and benefits virtually disappear.   These two consequences
are discussed in the next two sections.  
        3.2 The sensitivity of net present value to
the discount rate      
    The result of calculations performed according to the
formula above are extremely sensitive to the choice of the
discount rate.  
    Consider for example, a company planning to build a
new power plant.   Should they build a coal-burning plant or
a hydroelectric plant?   Most of the cost of the thermally
generated electricity is due to the cost of coal - a stream of
costs that stretches into the future.   On the other hand,
most of the cost of hydroelectricity is due to plant
construction and is therefore concentrated in the present.  
    Suppose, for the sake of illustration, the coal plant
would burn a million dollars worth of coal a year.   The
present cost of the coal burned in the twentieth year would be
$149,000 at d = 10% but $554,000 at d = 3%.   Thus a high
discount rate favours the thermal plant because the fuel costs
are heavily discounted.   Conversely, a low discount rate
favours construction of a hydroelectric plant.  
    An interesting example of the sensitivity of economic
viability to the choice of discount rate occurred in 1959 when
a CBA was performed on the proposed Passamaquoddy tidal power
project.   This was advocated as a joint Canadian-USA
venture.   The Americans used a discount rate of 2.5%
resulting in a positive present value but the Canadians used a
discount rate of 4.125% resulting in a negative present value
(Stokey and Zeckhauser, 1978, pp.164-165).   Presumably, the
rational way out of the impasse - the Canadians subsidising
the Americans - was not politically feasible.  
    In New Zealand in the seventies the loss of "economic
viability" due to an increase in discount rate was used to
curb over-enthusiastic government investment in irrigation
projects.   The Treasury insisted on a 15% discount rate for
one class of projects rather than the standard 10% as a
discouragement tactic (Pers. comm., A. McArthur, Lincoln
University, 1990).   A more direct method of expressing
doubt would be preferable.  
    This sensitivity would not matter if discount rates
could be determined objectively.   But, historically, social
discount rates have varied over a considerable range.  
        3.3 The long term      
    A second consequence of the mathematics of discounting
is that, even at low social discount rates, the value placed
on the welfare of future generations fades away to virtually
nothing.
        "  The economic theory of
discounting is a completely rational theory.   For short
periods of time it gives answers that seem intuitively right.
  For longer periods, we are not so sure  "    
(Hardin, 1981, p.224).    
    There are many dramatic examples in the literature to
illustrate this effect.   Pearce uses a hypothetical example
involving the storage of radioactive waste (Pearce, 1983,
pp.52-53).   Imagine that we know that a $10 billion
accident will occur 500 years after we begin storing the
waste.   What is the present value of the cost of this
accident using the relatively low discount rate of 5%?  
  formula  
    In general, people do not understand the power of
compound interest (and, consequently, of discounting).
  This power may be better illustrated by discounting
backwards in time.   Manhattan Island was bought from its
native American owners for 24 dollars.   If we discount its
present value at 6% back to the time of purchase, then 24
dollars was expensive! (Pers. comm., P. Van Moeseke, Massey
University, 1989).  
        3.4 Some more definitions      
    Some more definitions will be useful at this
point.  
    What is the difference between discount rates and
interest rates?   Arithmetically, the two are the same but
they are used in different contexts.   Interest rates are
given to us&semi; they are exogenous whereas discount rates are
chosen    1        1     A good
explanation of the difference between interest rates and
discount rates is given in Stokey &amp; Zeckhauser, 1978,
pp.161-162.  .   (It is this element of choice and
therefore, of values, that leads to such controversy over
discounting.)  
    Further, the discount rate is a more general term than
the interest rate.   We do not speak of "social interest
rates".   Interest is earned on commodities including
dollars whereas discounting is applied beyond dollars to
utilities (Page, 1977a, p.149).  
    The difference between individual, market and social
discount rates has already been discussed.   There is one
further important term.   One reason why future values are
discounted is inflation&semi; we do not value $100 received next
year as highly as $100 now in our pockets because we do not
expect it to buy as much.   In social discounting, this
effect is usually subtracted out.   Thus, if inflation is
expected to average 8% over the time period of concern, a
  nominal   discount rate of 18% is equivalent to a
  real   discount rate of 10%.   Expression of an
NPV in   constant   dollars implies the use of a
real discount rate.  
    Discount rates are generally positive.   However,
they may be zero or even negative as we shall see further
on.  
        Chapter 4 Rationales for social
discounting      
        4.1 A mixture of rationales      
    The fundamental question to ask about discounting is
why do it at all.   To philosophers discounting is a
mechanism for constraining obligations, and to economists it
is a mechanism for trading off the future against the
present.  
    But these general answers do not tell us how to
discount&semi; refining the rationale - the   why   of
discounting - should tell us   how   to discount.
  And it is here that the controversy and the confusion
discussed in the first chapter originate.   Social
discounting is based on a mix of (rarely stated)
rationales.  
    It may be thought that rationales are revealed by the
choice of discount rate.   But this does not necessarily
follow.   While a high discount rate is generally taken as
indicating less regard for the future, it could also, for
instance, reflect a great pessimism about the future of
humankind.  
    In this chapter I describe the various rationales that
are given or assumed when the discounting mechanism is used.
  Various writers have discussed these rationales&semi; the most
complete attempts I have come across are those by the moral
philosopher Derek Parfit (1983) and the public policy analyst
Robert Goodin (1982).   By focusing on the work of these two
I do not wish to imply that economists are ignorant of their
views.  
    Parfit lists six separate rationales and Goodin, four,
but they cover much the same ground.   These rationales are
listed in Table 1.   table    
    Goodin 's approach is much closer to the standard
economic approach that forms the basis for the next chapter.
  Parfit goes somewhat deeper.   He is not content to
accept pure time preference as a rationale&semi; he wants to know
why people give preference to that which is closer in
time.  
    The following discussion of Parfit 's arguments is
similar to that in Wright (1988).   I have decided to
reproduce it here because the arguments may become clearer in
a different context.  
        4.2 Democracy      
    This argument is that if the majority of people in a
country believe there is no need to worry about the future,
then neither should the government.   Individuals generally
discount the future heavily and therefore so should a
democratically elected government.   Public policy should
reflect the psychological time preference of the electors.  
    Parfit counters this by arguing that moral
justification does not rest on majority beliefs.   We do not
approve Nazism because a majority of Germans supported
it.  
        4.3 Probability      
    Uncertainty as a rationale for time discounting is
presented at the beginning of utilitarian thought where
Bentham gives it as one of two factors diminishing the value
of a pleasure or a pain (Goodin, 1982, p.56).  
    The argument goes that uncertainty correlates with
remoteness - in time, and in space to a lesser degree.   We
are uncertain about what will be viewed as valuable in the
future&semi; we are uncertain about the results of our actions and
policies&semi; we are uncertain about the achievements of future
technology.   Therefore, when we look ahead to future costs
and benefits, we scale down their size.  
    But uncertainty does not always correlate with
remoteness.
        "...   ignorance does not proceed
by fixed percentage increments each year  "    
(Wenz, 1983, p.208).   and:
        "  When applied to the further
future, many predictions are indeed   more   likely to
be true  "     (Parfit, 1983, p.33).    
        4.4 Opportunity costs      
    This is the   "  most orthodox
justification  "   for discounting (Goodin, 1982,
p.58).   Benefits received earlier rather than later can be
reinvested to yield more benefits.   Thus, the argument is
that the discount rate(s) used in the evaluation of public
investments should be based on the rate of return that would
be earned by alternative uses of the money.   Under this
reasoning, a zero discount rate is considered to favour the
future over the present.  
    A basic problem with opportunity cost discounting is
that it fails to distinguish between   investment  
and   consumption.  
        "  It says that if you are
thinking in terms of investments, you should demand the most
advantageous rate of return, and you should discount less
profitable investment opportunities in light of more rewarding
ones.   But there are some goods we want to consume rather
than reinvest  "     (Goodin, 1982,
pp.58-59).    
    Freeman has argued that the opportunity cost concept
of discounting can be used as a tool for intergenerational
  equity   as well as intergenerational
  efficiency   (Freeman, 1977).   Because
    "  the exponential arithmetic of discounting
works both ways  "    , part of the benefit from a
project can be invested to provide monetary compensation when
it is needed.    1        1  
  Suppose a project with a positive NPV is initiated that
imposes harms on the future.   Freeman argues that some of
the benefit from the project can be invested in order to
provide compensation for these future harms.   There will be
plenty of money for such compensation.   Just as discounting
rapidly erodes a large future value to a small present value,
interest compounds a small investment now into a large future
amount.   For some discussion of Freeman 's compensation
principle, see Mishan, 1982, pp.290-291, and Pearce, 1983,
pp.54-55.    
    There are a number of problems with this idea of an
intergenerational compensation fund.   There is no guarantee
of compensation.
        "  The standard argument for
discounting says that it is permissible to harm the future, as
long as it might be possible to benefit the future on net
balance by a compensating investment,   whether or not  
the investment is taken  "     (Page, 1983, p.55,
my emphasis).    
    Further there is a presupposition that everything can
be compensated for in money and another that
    "  the interest rate i actually   will  
prevail throughout the period  "    , an unlikely
possibility (Goodin, 1980).  
        4.5 Our successors will be better
off      
    If we believe that people in the future will be better
off than we are now, we may decide to discount future benefits
and costs.   In economic language this is known as
discounting for diminishing marginal utility.   As more of a
good is acquired the utility or benefit gained from each
additional unit of that good falls.   To not discount in an
increasingly rich society is tantamount to the poor
sacrificing for the rich.  
    Economists would question the validity of this
rationale for discounting.   They would prefer to see
decreasing or increasing marginal utility dealt with
explicitly by adjusting the values of future benefits and
costs before discounting.   However, this expectation does
feed into pure time preference.  
        4.6 Excessive sacrifice      
    Consider a situation in which the present generation
may bear a cost that yields benefits to an infinite number of
future generations.   No matter how large the present cost,
it will always be outweighed by the sum of future benefits no
matter how small the benefit to each future generation.  
    The corollary is that we must discount future benefits
in order to avoid being obliged to make intolerable sacrifices
for future people.  
    Parfit argues that although   "  the argument
from excessive sacrifice  "   may be a valid reason
for discounting in some instances, it is irrational to use it
as a general argument for social discounting.
        "  Suppose that, at the same cost
to ourselves now, we could prevent either a minor catastrophe
in the nearer future or a major catastrophe in the further
future.   Since preventing the major catastrophe would
involve no extra cost, the Argument from Excessive Sacrifice
fails to apply.   But if we take that argument to justify a
discount rate, we can be led to conclude that the major
catastrophe is less worth preventing  "    
(Parfit, 1983, p.35).    
        4.7 Special relations      
    It is observed that humans feel the greatest
obligations to those closest to them both in space and in
time.   People feel greater responsibility to their children
than to other children or to their great grandchildren.
  Most of us recognise stronger obligations to those with
whom we have a special relationship whether it be shared
blood, values, country, race, generation or whatever.
  Thus, we discount for   "  degrees of
kinship  "   (Parfit, 1983, pp.35-36).  
    This rationale is more commonly known as psychological
discounting or biological discounting&semi; economists tend to
capture it within the expression "pure time preference".  
    However, discounting for kinship is not always
acceptable.   Parfit uses the example of atmospheric nuclear
tests.   Governments who protect their own citizens at the
expense of aliens are not generally considered to be acting
morally (Parfit, 1983, p.36).  
    Further,   "  degrees of
kinship  "   do not decrease according to the
mathematics of discounting.   We feel obligations most
strongly to the next generation, rather less to the next, and
after that it tends to level out.   Our feelings about the
fifth generation from now are no different from those about
the seventh generation from now.  
          4.8 Is a social discount rate
justified?      
    Parfit 's basic message is that   why   we
discount will determine   how   we discount.   He
sees the mathematics of opportunity cost discounting as
imposing an inappropriate form on other types of discounting.
  He is not saying that society should not discount but that
there is no justification for   a   social discount
rate, that is, for one formula and one value.  
        "  It may often be morally
permissible to be less concerned about the more remote effects
of our social policies.   But this would never be because
these effects are more remote.   Rather it would be because
they are less likely to occur, or will be effects on people
who are better off than we are, or because it is cheaper now
to ensure compensation - or it would be for one of the other
reasons I have given.   All these different reasons need to
be judged separately, on their merits.   To bundle them
together in a social discount rate is to blind our moral
sensibilities  "  (Parfit, 1983a,
p.36).        
  

      VIVIAN HUTCHINSON  
        The Planetary Pakeha      
    I am Vivian Hutchinson.   Born and brought up in
Taranaki, where I still live and work.   I love my mountain
and can't imagine being away from it for too long.   I 'm a
fifth-generation Pakeha New Zealander, my great-great-forebear
with the Hutchinson name having come to this country with the
65th Light Infantry Regiment.   His wife was from an English
coal-mining community.   On my mother 's side my male
ancestors derived from poor Scottish farming immigrants of
the McIntyre name, who brought up big families and worked the
soil here.   As family reunions have shown me, my
  ancestors'   blood has well and truly mixed with that of
the tangata whenua of these islands and I have many Maori
distant cousins.  
    I 'm from a family of four brothers scattered over this
country.   My father worked during his life as an engineer
and a manager of a wire firm servicing farms in Taranaki.
  He died when I was eighteen.   My mother has married
again and is retired to the harbour 's edge near Whangarei.
  One of my brothers fought in Vietnam and was a leader in
the South Island Territorials, but now grows carnations in
a thriving business.   Another has worked for years in soil
and water conservation issues for various authorities in the
South Island, and farms goats.   The third has worked in
surveying and also for himself, and more recently has spent
many years on the dole happily raising his kids.   I am a
gay man and presently live with my love and partner in life,
Tony Hansen, in the Westown suburb of New Plymouth.  
    My vocation is trying to make a difference.   I used
to think I was a community worker.   Now I think of myself
as a social-change worker.   I won't pretend to be very
successful in my vocation, but I believe I have
persistence.  
    I am particularly interested in making a difference to
unemployment and the future of work.   I see how this
also relates to poverty and deprivation in New Zealand and
questions of the future of the welfare state.   I am also
interested in bringing more love into economics.   And I
have been working on these issues in one way or another since
I left secondary school in 1973.  
    In doing something about these things, I have helped
the Salvation Army run its work schemes in Taranaki, and I
now work as community adviser to the Taranaki Work Trust,
helping manage a variety of projects aimed at the unemployed.
  I help people to start up their own businesses, and teach
the skills of enterprise.   I write.  
    I am fatter than most people, weighing in at nineteen
stone.   I have my front teeth missing.   I love swimming
at Back Beach near our Sugarloaf Islands.   I particularly
enjoy watching music on television, and every now and then
I 'll learn a song for myself.   I read the
  Dominion   and especially like the Doonesbury cartoons
on page two.  
    I am a friend and keen supporter of the Tauhara Centre
in Taupo and go there quite often.   I try to contribute to
its mission of creating a place where people of differing
viewpoints and methods of working can come together in a
search for truth, goodwill and understanding.  
    I am writing this chapter while taking a break in the
Tauhara chalet, overlooking a clear and blue summer 's
lake.  
    I call myself a Pakeha just because it feels
right.   I like it as a superficial label.   It tells me I
am primarily of European descent but have a special
relationship with these islands.   I am also wary of the
label.   I have never felt good about fences, particularly
fences of identity.   I seem to contain too many impulses
that shout otherwise.  
    I have also never felt good about people making
assumptions about me just because I am wearing a cultural
label.   I have been hurt by assumptions made of me... and
know I have hurt others by the assumptions I have made about
them.   Labels don't help.  
    But thinking of myself as Pakeha certainly means
something to me.  
    It means all the things I have learnt about being a
human being from attending kindergarten, primary, intermediate
and secondary schools, the Anglican Church... being brought up
in a fairly middle-class family, watching lots of television,
playing sport as a youngster, watching my brother go to war
and my uncle have a beer at the RSA, discovering how things
worked through inventions and new technology, learning the ins
and outs of family businesses, observing the festivals of the
year at Easter, Christmas and on Anzac Day.  
    These things are the inheritance of my parents, my
family and the context that I grew up in.   And when I was
growing up, these things all gave me an identity map which I
never really had the capacity to question.  
    I sure as hell did start to question things as soon as
I left home, however.   To some extent it was the fashion of
the day.   I remember at age eighteen reading James K.
Baxter when he summarised the Calvinist doctrines behind
our Pakeha way of life with four commandments:
    Work Is Good, Sex Is Bad, Do as You Are Told and
It Will Be All Right    , and     Don't Look
Too Deeply into Yourself    .  
    Sure, from the distance of now being thirtysomething,
it 's very much an oversimplified condemnation... but in my
teenage years it seemed a pretty good summary of what I was
rebelling against.  
    Fortunately at the time, I quickly realised that part
of being Pakeha also meant the freedom to say  'stuff you' to
all of this.   In the early seventies there seemed to be an
entire youth culture saying exactly that.   So when I left
home I got on with my own journey, which led me to discover
the gifts of many of the different ways of living on these
islands and on this planet at this time.   Even though I
have ended up with a lifestyle and view of who I am that is
very different from my   parents'   and the way of life
they handed on to me, I still call myself Pakeha.   It is a
label of preference.   And I hope that when I meet people we
can both greet our preferred labels... and somehow also get
beyond them.  
    I don't deny the gifts I receive from being
Pakeha.   They are many and varied.   It 's just that I 'm
the sort of person who is going to pick and choose the gifts I
want to hold close to myself.   Some of the gifts I can
indeed treasure.   Others I have some trouble with.  
    Some of the things about being Pakeha that I am proud
of include our love for this land, our links with Britain,
Jesus and the Christian teachings, symphony orchestras,
musicians like Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and Sting, composers like
Mozart and Bach, reading John Mortimer, art galleries,
shopping, mystery serials on television, Woolworths
supermarkets, Ford Falcon station-wagons,   Footrot
Flats  , Prince Charles, hippies, the New Age, the circus,
being in business, camping at the beach, and the Labour
Party.  
    Some of the things about being Pakeha that I don't
feel so good about include the continuing legacy of injustice
between Pakeha and Maori, the way we gay people get treated,
two world wars, Korea, Vietnam and now the Gulf, bureaucracy,
unemployment, the cutting down of native trees and the
pollution of our rivers, and the Labour Party.  
    I used to think   culture   was to do with
what we believed in and what we did with each other, and who
we celebrated and valued: rugby, Jesus, the Queen, Labour Day,
the Concert Programme, pavlovas, Mark Todd, a good beer,
patchwork quilts,   KZ7   and the Bank of New
Zealand.  
    It 's like we pull all these things around us like a
cloak and they somehow define who we are.   Our leading
writers and television ad people use all these images to
describe us, and politicians use the prevailing concepts to
define policies that will suit us and keep us voting for
them.  
    But lately I have been wanting to take a few steps
back from this and ask myself: What 's the purpose of culture
anyway?   Do I belong to my culture, or does it belong to
me?   Who decides the rules of what 's right and wrong?
  Are articles and books like this part of some insidious
process of defining and therefore later controlling our
images of who we think we are?  
    We 've all been talking about this culture and
identity stuff quite a bit lately, haven't we?   I put it
down to '1990' and celebrating the hundred and fifty years of
the Treaty of Waitangi, as well as other various
anniversaries.   It just kept on bringing things up for us
all to chew over.   And not before time, either.  
    The 1990 concert at Bastion Point, grand opening
ceremonies at the Commonwealth Games, the Queen at Waitangi,
the waka, Gallipoli Anzac celebrations, Kiri in the park, the
ANZ 'Magic Minutes' on television... it 's all been a real
mixed bag, struggling for that elusive consensus on who we
think we are.    
    As I write, it was only just last year.   And,
looking back, we seemed to be having two discussions at once
on what it was to be a New Zealander.  
    First there was the official and polite discussion,
which was full of television propaganda: images and music of
the victory of the New Zealand identity, and how Maori and
Pakeha were getting on so well.  
    But behind all this there was this tentative, almost
embarrassed exploration I seemed to be witnessing almost
everywhere else whenever the subject of 1990 came up.   Here
people talked about just what Kiwi identity at this
hundred-and-fifty-year report card point is bringing up for
them.   And it has brought up some unsettling pictures of
challenge and change.  
    Treaty issues, one in nine people officially out of
work, the widening gap between rich and poor, the knife going
into our visions of the welfare state, the GATT talks in
Brussels breaking up, overcrowded prisons, a man in Aramoana
going berserk with a gun, war in the Gulf... these are the
images many of us carried with us into 1991.  
    I don't know about you, but I seemed to be
surrounded by people who found that 1990 didn't reflect who
they felt they were.   Perhaps the television
picture-streams and accompanying soundtracks were more a
picture of who we thought we   should   be rather than
the reality of who we are.   If you just think for a while
about all the different people you know who are also New
Zealanders and share your life and never appeared in those
video-montages of self-identity, you 'll have a sense of what
an impossible job it is to get a picture of our wholeness
anyway.  
    And that 's okay!  
    In fact I think that   that is the point  .  
    The point being that our vision of what it is to be a
New Zealander is leading to more and more diversity as the
years go on.  
    And this brings with it its own struggle... the
struggle to develop an image of ourselves that holds together
and honours all these scattered pieces.  
    Difference.   That 's the terror of all this
culture stuff.  
    And it seems to be the constant challenge to human
beings everywhere... how on earth do we grow up enough inside
ourselves to really cope with the difference within and
between cultural labels?  
    I for one have always been fascinated with discovering
the variations on how to be a human being.   When I was
nineteen I took out a weekly subscription on one of those
Marshall Cavendish build-your-own-encyclopedia magazines
called   The Family of Man  .   I wished it was called
  The Family of People  , but I still bought it and
loved it.  
    Every week there was a profile of at least a dozen
different racial groups or cultures... their history, their
lives today, their customs and attitudes.   It was
superficial but fascinating.   And for me it was a little
humbling to start to get a sense of humanity on its fuller
diversity.  
    But while collecting the information on difference is
one thing, having to live with it is another.  
    Difference is the thing that can bring up our greatest
fears, vulnerability and insecurity... the deep gut feelings
of Other that can arise when we are confronted with another
culture, or a hidden subculture within our shared life.
  It 's a feeling that can strike you unawares... can make
you do the most regrettable things.   Hasn't the longest
part of human conflict been fed from this raw place?  
    It would be easier to have a unity... easier to have
consensus... easier to have an assimilation that can absorb
all those rough-edges that make people different from one
another.   But I don't think we ever really did have a time
like that... nor do I think the future holds such a time for
us.  
    The challenge has always been obvious to me.   We
are just going to have to transform our attitude towards
difference.   I think it starts with esteeming our own
unique qualities personally and then seriously thinking about
how to treasure the difference in others.  
    More than this.  
    I think we can learn to accept the differences we see
out there as something that may contain important information
for ourselves... information for our own journeys and
choices ahead... information that has yet to be discovered
through our present cultural forms.  
    Perhaps the first time many Pakeha people have to
face their own sense of difference, is when they start to
interact with the Maori people of these islands.   In fact
I 'd offer the opinion that it is unlikely that many Pakeha
people in this country can define themselves without the First
People appearing in the wings of that definition somewhere.
  Not that I think there is anything wrong with that.
  There 's many a time I 've sat on the marae and heard an
orator define his Maoritanga in terms of how it differed from
Pakeha New Zealanders.  
    There 's an essential truth in there somewhere.
  That it 's very much easier to define your identity when
you are faced with a striking difference in attitudes, beliefs
and protocols such as we find between the two dominant races
here in Aotearoa.  
    And like it or not, Pakeha identity is woven into
these differences.   Despite all the rhetoric about us
all being New Zealanders and   tatou tatou  , Maori
people are not Pakeha.   And there are differences there
that cannot and should not be put into the common pot.  
    Perhaps I should just speak for myself.  
    I am certain my own experiences with Maori people have
led me more than anything else to re-examine my identity and
look again at my notions of just what culture is.   And
these experiences are a little different from what my family
upbringing would have led me to expect.  
    It was James K. Baxter who opened the door for me (and
many like me) through his poetry and articles, which reflected
a synthesis of the two main cultures here in New Zealand.
  I was reading his stuff while still at school, but I just
knew that he was writing something that was deep   within
me   as well.  
    As soon as I left school I decided to find out more
about Maori things, which took me to meeting Matarena Raumati
Rau-Kupa, a local Taranaki Maori elder also known as Aunty
Marge.   She invited me to nearby Parihaka, where together
with her husband Pepe Rau she was leading the rebuilding
of one of the famous Parihaka meeting houses,
Te-Niho-o-Te-Atiawa.   I loved Marge as soon as I met her,
and we found it easy to be good friends, despite our obvious
distance in age as well as culture.  
    What followed for me was a social and spiritual
re-education over the next few years, which took place almost
fully within a Maori context.   Considering the powerful
history of non-violent struggle at Parihaka against the
government (in the 1880s), it was a compassionate re-education
on what it was to be a New Zealander and how to come to grips
with some of the darker chapters in our history of race
relations.  
    I moved to Auckland to train as a journalist, and in
something of an informal social-worker apprenticeship, I
also worked on the streets of the inner city with Maori
community workers Betty Wark and Fred Ellis.   Betty and I
worked on many issues together, some of which led to setting
up the Arohanui hostels for street people.  
    My education in things Maori continued with meeting
Whina Cooper and working closely with her whanau in the
preparations, staging and strategy of the Maori Land March of
1975.   I did much writing and research into Maori Land
claims, particularly Bastion Point and the Raglan golf course
case.  
    When I shifted back to Taranaki in 1978, Marge and I
organised a seven-year cycle of annual gatherings at
Parihaka designed to introduce other Pakeha people to things
Maori and explore their own cultural boundaries.  
    More recently, as someone who now works primarily in
the employment and job creation arena, I have naturally
continued to have a good deal to do with Maori people,
particularly on economic issues and developing self-help
initiatives for the unemployed.  
    With all this behind me, I used to think that because
I have had lots of special experiences in a Maori context, I
understood Maori people very well.   Not true.   I am
constantly surprised at the ingenuity of many of these people,
the fertility of the way the culture absorbs and re-invents
itself in so many ways.   And that very present difference
in attitude that always has been a challenge to me as well as
a delight.  
    I think it 's more than this, though.  
    The more I have had to do with Maori people, I have
realised that I wasn't so much finding out about them - I was
finding out much more about myself.  
    This is the   identity   thing again.   Much
of my awareness of this was just lying dormant there within me
until I ran into a situation of   difference  , which
brought things up to the surface for me to look at.  
    When faced with things Maori - some of which entranced
me, some of which I found I didn't agree with - I certainly
had to get my head together on who I thought I was... and get
clear about those things that were within me.   And this
brings me back again... to   culture  , and the frames
we put around these pictures of our identity.  
    Culture has never been a static thing.   It is
an organic dynamic changing pulling pushing collection of bits
and pieces that tell us how we are getting on with being
human.   And these days I am starting to see culture as a
  strategy for awareness  .  
    I imagine somewhere in our collective history we have
discovered things that have worked: an Anglican communion
service, the rules of rugby, how to cook steak on a barbie,
decorating a Christmas tree, handing out the prizes at a
school athletics meet.  
    They are processes on how to get a job done.   They
contain all the opinions and beliefs and discussions that have
created those processes in the first place.   If we continue
to do it the same way, it becomes culture.   If we pass it
on to others or our kids it becomes tradition.   Stick at it
long enough and these processes seem to grow into the bones of
a people and become incredibly binding and defining of who we
think we are.  
    I say a  'strategy for awareness', because that 's what
I reckon is behind all this: developing our human awareness...
finding out what it is to be a human being... telling us how
to get on with our own stories.  
    Culture is a way that we have packaged up bits of the
collective software on how to do all this, whether it is
in questions of sport, spirituality, restaurant etiquette, or
in annual festivals.   Different people, different times,
different places&semi; they have all given rise to different
strategies.   And these strategies are all a part of the
performance of their truth... as best as they can be aware of
it at the time.  
    What 's happening today is that we are becoming very
aware of how other people are creating quite different
strategies for getting the same jobs done.   And within
the broad bands of cultural and subcultural identity labels -
Pakeha, American, Maori, country music buffs, lesbian,
whatever - there 's an enormous diversity.   That 's the
point.     This drive for difference.   An
evolution of human beings based on difference.  
    It 's like the equal drive in the natural kingdom of
plants and insects and animals... creating more and more
diverse species as the march of time progresses over billions
of years.   What we have ended up with in nature today is an
incredibly fragile and irreplaceable bank of genetic
information scattered throughout the planet, much of which we
are only beginning to understand: a plant in the Amazon holds
a genetic treasure that will solve leukaemia, perhaps a weed
near Invercargill holds part of the solution to the AIDS
virus.  
    Now it 's the same with culture.   The different
cultures on the planet are driven towards greater diversity, a
drive from within each of them.   And each of these diverse
groups contains valuable information for the human journey -
information we are also only now starting to really learn how
to understand.  
      My present map of all this is a keyboard like
that on a piano.   I like to think of it as the keyboard of
potential of how to be a human being.  
    Different cultures come and seem to dance over certain
notes on this keyboard.   They keep to certain tunes.
  They may leave whole sections of the keyboard completely
untouched.  
    When cultures come in dialogue to one another, they
share parts of the keyboard they know.   They sing the songs
they have discovered within them that have grown in response
to this keyboard.  
    Now I don't think there is any such thing as cultural
property rights on this keyboard.   You may choose to
dispute this point of view, but I believe this human keyboard
is an instrument that 's there within all of us and has all
sorts of sounds waiting dormant to be struck and discovered
for use.  
    I was once on the marae with a group of Americans when
one of the aunts called out her karanga in that way many of us
have heard that makes the air chill and the sound penetrate
every bone in your body.   The woman next to me said,
  'Wow.     My gut has just hit the ground.
  Those Maoris have got something very special
here!  '    
    I looked at her and remarked, 'Yes.   But it was
also   your   gut that hit the ground.   You may not
have known it before, but I 'll bet you have much the same
stuff within you.   You may not have struck that note on
your keyboard before.   But it is there, waiting.'  
    What 's tugging at all this... is
  change  .  
    Rapid change.   More change than many other
generations of the human race have had to face.   Whether
it 's in the economic, social, spiritual, technological
landscapes surrounding us, they are all shifting sands at this
time.   And it 's bringing out both the best and the worst in
us.  
    This constant change makes an equally constant assault
on our identities, on our security of who we think we are.
  That 's not comfortable.   One of the popular views of
culture is that it gives us something solid to hang onto -
that way we don't have to constantly think up solutions to our
lives.   We don't have to constantly question our ways
of doing things.   Culture can provide a refuge against all
these changes around us.  
    My theory is that it is this desire for a safe place
from change, that can quickly throw up the cultural dogmas and
fundamentalism that are also very much part of these
times.   But that 's always the problem with refuges.   The
mobile electric fences that graze the edges of our identities
can quickly turn into brick walls.      
  

          Review Of Research On Wellbeing, Self
Esteem And Interpersonal Relationships      
        Wellbeing      
    The last twenty years have seen the emergence of the
concept of subjective wellbeing as a global self assessment of
personal happiness which can serve as a central component in
the measurement of quality of life.   Classic works in the
area include "The Structure of Psychological Wellbeing" by
Norman Bradburn (1969), "The Quality of American Life" (1976)
by Campbell, Converse and Rodgers, "Social Indicators of
Wellbeing" (1976) by Andrews and Withey and Diener 's 1984
review entitled "Subjective Wellbeing".  
    In New Zealand, a series of studies was carried out or
supervised by Richard Kammann between 1975 and 1983 which
involved issues in the assessment and correlates of wellbeing.
  These studies led to the development of the Affectometer 2
(Kammann &amp; Flett, 1983), a 40 item scale measuring subjective
wellbeing.   Results of investigations of the Affectometer 2
(Kammann, Farry and Herbison, 1984&semi; Kammann &amp; Flett, 1986&semi;
Flett, 1986) led Kammann and Flett to define the concept of
subjective wellbeing in terms of a predominance of positive or
good feelings and a complete and lasting satisfaction with
life as a whole which imply feelings of cheerfulness, energy,
freedom, a sense of purpose and control and the feeling that
life is meaningful.   Other researchers have similarly
defined wellbeing in terms of a cognitive (life satisfaction)
component and an affective (balance between positive and
negative affect) component (Diener, 1984).  
    A number of criticisms have been raised with respect
to the measurement of wellbeing.   It has been suggested
that it is just a measure of depression or current mood.
  The potential biasing effect of social desirability on
responses has also been raised.   However, an examination of
the data suggests that these criticisms are unwarranted.  
    Studies by Diener and his colleagues in the United
States and by Kammann &amp; Flett (1983) in New Zealand agree
closely on how wellbeing relates to other variables.
  Although depression inventories (such as the Beck
Depression Inventory) generally correlate about 0.70 with
global measures of wellbeing, the relationship is a
curvilinear one as depression inventories fail to
differentiate adequately amongst the non-depressed members
of the population.   Wellbeing measures also show positive
skew but are more effective in differentiating positive
respondents and are thus more useful in assessing the health
of a population as opposed to diagnosing illness.  
    Both mood and social desirability measures correlate
with wellbeing.   The data demonstrate a high stability of
wellbeing scores over time which would not be expected if
current and presumably transient moods were exerting a
significant causal influence.   It was also found that mood
correlates as highly with wellbeing a week earlier or a week
later suggesting that current mood is a manifestation of
wellbeing rather than a source of response bias (Kammann &amp;
Flett, 1986&semi; Flett, 1986).  
    Correlations between wellbeing and social desirability
tend to be about 0.30 in most studies.   The relatively
small size of the correlation coefficient makes it clear that
subjective wellbeing cannot be equated with social
desirability.  
    It can also be argued that social desirability is
itself a problematic concept.   The desire to appear in a
good light is likely to be confounded with the reality that
one is experiencing the positive aspects of life and achieving
socially desirable goals.   Any individual who is
conscientious, well-adjusted and cooperative is likely to
score highly on social desirability scales.   Costa &amp; McCrae
(1983) present evidence for renaming social desirability and
lie scales as measures of "social adjustment" and suggest that
to interpret correlations with other measures and social
desirability as evidence for invalidity, is unjustified.  
    A related issue here is the claim that people
exaggerate or overestimate their own levels of wellbeing.
  Kammann and Flett (1983b) note that scores on their
measure of wellbeing (Affectometer 2) tend to be skewed with
the mean and median lying more than one standard deviation
above the midpoint of the scale.   This finding is standard
for all measures of wellbeing (Andrews &amp; Withey, 1976&semi;
Campbell, Converse &amp;     Rogers    Rodgers    ,
1976).   Although it has been argued that this indicates
that self reports of wellbeing are therefore exaggerated
and untrustworthy, there is no additional evidence to support
this point of view.   Kammann (1984) argues that it may be
incorrect to assume that people should calculate their
happiness relative to the average level.   Rather, they may
calculate it in terms of an inner scale of experience that
runs from the worst feelings ever experienced to the best
feelings ever experienced and most of the time they are closer
to the favourable endpoint.  
    The relationships between wellbeing and physical
health, sociodemographic variables, stressful life events,
self-esteem and interpersonal relationships are of
considerable interest and will therefore be dealt with under
individual headings.  
        Wellbeing and Physical Health      
    Wellbeing is related to physical health.   A
meta-analysis by Okun et al (1984) examined findings from 81
studies.   Correlations between all physical health measures
(from poor to excellent) and wellbeing were estimated as 0.30
on average (between .29 and .35 at 95% confidence bounds for
zero-order effects).  
    Significant findings were strongest and most
frequently reported for self-reported assessment of physical
health.   Non-significant findings were more often reported
when objective health indices were used, such as the number of
health ailments.   On the other hand, some studies reported
a significant association with objective criteria such as
number of days spent in bed and reduced functional capacity.
  Conflicting findings were reported with respect to the
presence of a recent health problem.   Zautra and Hempel
(1984) discuss the Okun et al., findings and conclude that
while there is clearly a relationship between physical health
and subjective wellbeing, this is probably moderated by
important life style changes associated with changes in health
and/or wellbeing.   They suggest that further research is
necessary to establish the direction and nature of causal
links between these variables.   Personality and social
factors such as methods of coping and social support are seen
as probable moderator variables affecting the impact of
changes in life style on the relation between physical health
and wellbeing.  
    Kammann and Flett 's New Zealand studies also
demonstrate a link between a sense of physical health and
psychological wellbeing, although actual disease and the
presence of diagnosable complaints do not seem to affect
wellbeing (Kammann et al., 1984&semi; Kammann &amp; Flett, 1986&semi; Flett,
1986).   These New Zealand results are in line with those of
Krupinski and McKenzie (1979) in Australia.   Flett
interprets these results using Brickman 's argument (Brickman
et al., 1978) that although major changes such as acute
illness may impact on wellbeing at the time that they occur,
people eventually adapt to all events regardless of their
initial impact.   Thus Flett suggests that the important
health correlate is   "a sense of bodily health and
energy"   which is related to an absence of somatic
complaints.  
        Wellbeing And Socio-Demographic
Indicators      
    In general most of the major studies of wellbeing only
find small associations between wellbeing and demographic
indicators.  
    The meta-analysis by Okun et al (1984) of 81 studies
found that age was an important moderator variable in
increasing the relationship between physical health and
wellbeing.   The mean correlation increased from 0.30 to
0.42 when age was controlled for as, although physical health
deteriorates with age, subjective wellbeing tends to increase.
  Diener (1984), in his review emphasises the
conflicting findings with respect to age but suggests that
older people tend to report more general satisfaction with
most life domains although younger people experience more
intense feelings of both positive and negative affect.
  Larson (1978) in his review of thirty years  '  
research on age and wellbeing concludes that although there is
a decline in the subjective wellbeing of those over the
age of 60, this decline appears to be a product of the other
negative factors that impinge upon the very old such as
decreased health, decreased financial resources, widowhood,
loss of friends and decreased activity.  
    Gender has only been weakly associated with wellbeing
if at all and often the findings are affected by other
variables such as age and partnership status (Diener,
1984).  
    Socio-economic class emerged as a factor which was
linked with both wellbeing and physical health in the Okun et
al., (1984) meta-analysis although they point out that
both income and education proved to be irrelevant variables.
  On the other hand Larson (1978) reports a positive
association between wellbeing and income within countries, a
finding also reported in a review by Easterlin (1974).
  Between country comparisons (Diener, 1984) show weaker
associations while subjective satisfaction with income
produces stronger findings.   These facts lead researchers
to conclude that it is the subjective evaluation of income and
comparisons with others in the immediate social
environment rather than absolute level which is a principal
determinant although this is not to deny the negative
effects of real poverty.   Findings in New Zealand have
shown slight effects at best but the data were collected prior
to the major changes in income differentiation which have
marked the last five years.  
    Employment status has been frequently linked to
wellbeing (Diener, 1984).   Almost all the major studies
show that unemployment causes a marked drop in subjective
wellbeing and that even more marked effects are noted in the
long-term unemployed.   Such findings have been replicated
in New Zealand by Hesketh (1984) and Macky (1987).  
    Social indicator research has often attempted to
define geographical areas which differ in terms of affluence,
privilege and services.   Such studies have helped highlight
issues of poverty and deprivation and have assisted in
targeting services to those most in need.   In 1985 a
Department of Health study (Reinkein et al, 1985) classified
geographical areas throughout New Zealand on the basis of
criteria derived from census information which emerged as a
single factor from a complex multivariate analysis.   A
subset of areas differentiated by the analysis were
described as   "areas of misery"   and
  "pockets of bliss"  .   The indicators include
such variables as income, education, socio-economic status,
being employed, number of cars and race.  
    While such an approach can be practically very useful
in guiding the delivery of social services, there are problems
in assuming an automatic relationship between social indicator
scales based on census variables and subjective wellbeing.
      Calhoun    Colhoun     and others (see
    Calhoun    Colhoun    , 1988&semi; Colhoun &amp;
Maxwell, 1986) surveyed a random sample of people from each of
two   "areas of misery"  , two   "pockets of
bliss"   and three intermediate areas in Dunedin city (n
= 193).   They measured social indicators and also assessed
wellbeing, self-esteem, close relationships and physical
health.   The data showed that although most of the expected
social indicator differences were replicated, there were no
significant overall differences between the areas in
subjective wellbeing or self-esteem.   Nor were the areas
differentiated in general physical health.    
    On the other hand, this study found some evidence of
an association between loneliness, poor physical health, a
lack of close relationships and low income in the
  "areas of misery"   which probably points to the
large numbers of beneficiaries and pensioners who live alone
and whose general circumstances make it difficult for them
to maintain close relationships with others.  
    These results demonstrate that social indicators do
not necessarily predict human happiness.   Geographical
areas can be differentiated in terms of socio-economic
factors.   Some of these factors are indeed linked to
wellbeing and, in this study, were definitely linked to
loneliness.   But while the areas may be poor or rich, they
should not be referred to in terms of bliss and misery as such
terms do not describe the feelings the people themselves
express about their lives.   Poverty can be degrading and it
can make people unhappy but in New Zealand today, the
Department of Health 's   "areas of misery"   are
in need of services and employment opportunities rather than
inaccurate labels that might further reduce the self-esteem of
those who live there.  
        Wellbeing And Stressful
Life-Events      
    Often studies have failed to demonstrate a link
between stressful life events and wellbeing.   This is
partly because many of the studies have selected events that
observers believe will be negative without in fact asking
whether the person experiencing the event has found it so.
  It is also partly because in many studies there has been a
tendency to assess the occurrence of an event without regard
to its recency.  
    Major catastrophes such as becoming a paraplegic, have
not necessarily led to chronically lowered wellbeing but there
is certainly an initial impact (Brickman et al, 1978).
  There is substantial support for the negative effects of
major changes in relationships, such as the breakup of a
partnership, on wellbeing (Kessler et al, 1985&semi; Andrews &amp;
Withey, 1976&semi; Campbell, Converse &amp; Rodgers, 1976).   There
is also support for the impact of hassles in one 's daily life
(Delongis et al, 1985), and as noted earlier, the effects of
unemployment.  
    In New Zealand, Flett (1986) found that negative
events perceived by respondents as involving major failures,
loss of social support and tense times were related to
wellbeing although the effects were not great.   Maxwell &amp;
Robertson (1988) have demonstrated the impact of marital
breakup on wellbeing in a sample of Family Court clients.
  They also report a link between wellbeing and the stress
of life changes, both in terms of the number of changes and
their rated impact.   Replications of the negative effects
of unemployment have already been noted.  
        Wellbeing And Self-Esteem      
    Self-esteem is one of the strongest predictors of
wellbeing (Diener, 1984) and has often been regarded as its
strongest component.   Furthermore self-esteem drops
during periods of unhappiness (Diener, 1984).   Although
self-esteem is related to wellbeing, it is not identical.
  Correlations vary from .35 to .70 depending on the
measures used.  
    Conceptually, self-esteem and wellbeing are both
expressions of satisfaction with aspects of life.
  Self-esteem focusses on satisfaction with self and
wellbeing on overall life satisfaction.   Thus wellbeing is
affected by satisfaction with all aspects of life.
  Satisfaction with oneself has usually been noted as the
most important component.   Campbell (1981) examined
correlations between subjective wellbeing and satisfaction
with various life domains.   The highest correlation was
0.55 with satisfaction with self.   This finding has been
replicated in New Zealand by McIntosh (1985) who found a
correlation of 0.57 between wellbeing and self-esteem in a
sample of 105 university students and by Colhoun (1988) who
found a correlation of 0.41 in a sample of 101 people drawn
randomly from the Dunedin electoral rolls.  
    Satisfaction with work impacts on both wellbeing and
self-esteem.   The relationship between wellbeing and
unemployment has already been discussed above.   Those
studies which also include self-esteem scales show that
self-esteem is lowered by lack of job satisfaction and by
unemployment.   Australasian studies confirm these findings.
  McIntosh (1985) reported that satisfaction with university
work was important for self-esteem, particularly for male
students.   Macky (1987) compared employed and unemployed
school leavers and found that the unemployed were more
depressed and showed lowered self-esteem.   This result is
in line with Australian data (Patton &amp; Noller, 1984).
  Hesketh (1984) studied unemployed adults and found that
the longer people were unemployed, the more likely they were
to be depressed and this was particularly true of the middle
aged unemployed.   Unemployment was also linked to other
negative life circumstances such as family problems and poor
living conditions.   Her work led her to conclude that not
just unemployment but the quality of working conditions
has a very important impact on wellbeing.  
    McIntosh 's 1985 study examined a variety of sources of
self-esteem and wellbeing in a sample of 105 university
students.   She demonstrated that the most important
predictors of self-esteem were satisfaction with university
work, body image, close relationships and the living
environment and those in it.   Body image and leisure
activities were more important for females than males.
  However, if body image is seen as unimportant,
satisfaction with body image is unrelated to self-esteem.
  While self-esteem and wellbeing were related and
responsive to the same factors (r = .57), wellbeing appeared
less vulnerable to differences in satisfaction with various
life domains.  
        Wellbeing and Interpersonal
Relationships      
    Effective social support is the other (with
self-esteem) most important correlate of subjective wellbeing
and has also been seen as an intrinsic part of psychological
health.   The beneficial effects of social support have
become increasingly evident in studies of health and
psychological adjustment (e.g., Brown &amp; Harris, 1978&semi; Thoits,
1982&semi; Wortman, 1984&semi; Kessler et al., 1985 and others).   In
studies of wellbeing, the quality and nature of interpersonal
relationships emerges as the single most important predictor.
  Campbell, Converse and Rodgers (1976) in their
extensive survey of "The Quality of American Life", conclude
that it is   "intimate areas of primary relationships
which have the most potent impact on general feelings of
wellbeing enjoyed by members of the population"  .  
    There are several different aspects of interpersonal
relationships that have been related to wellbeing (Diener,
1984).   Married people are generally reported as happier.
  Satisfaction with one 's love life has also been linked to
wellbeing and so too is having a close confidant.   Greater
amounts of social contact have been found to be associated
with increased wellbeing.   George &amp; Fillenbaum (1985) in
their review of the factors that have proved important in
studies of older people, suggest that wellbeing is related to
all of the three components that have been identified as
comprising social support: the frequency of contact, the
availability of emotional support and tangible assistance
and the perceived quality of relationships.   The key role
of satisfaction rather than amount of contact is emphasised
throughout the social support literature and focusses
attention again on the subjective evaluation of life
circumstances rather than their objective nature.  
    New Zealand studies echo the overseas findings.
  Dixon (1981) confirms that married people tend to be
happier than unmarried.   Flett found small significant
correlations between wellbeing and the total number of people
in the person 's network (r = .21) and the average closeness to
all of them (r = .26).   He found higher correlations
between wellbeing and closeness to the five closest people (r
= .41) and closeness to the closest person (r = .47).
  These results can be compared with the findings from
Colhoun and Maxwell (1985) which used a different methodology.
  They found a correlation between wellbeing and closeness
to the closest person of r = .28.   Wellbeing showed even
higher correlations with overall satisfaction with
relationships, (r = .55) and loneliness (r = -.52).  
    Not only do positive aspects of relationships predict
wellbeing but the absence of close relationships and problems
with relationships predict lowered wellbeing (Clark &amp; Reis,
1988).   Loneliness can be seen as dissatisfaction with
close relationships.   Such a view is reinforced by the
correlations between loneliness and wellbeing.  
    New Zealand studies of general population samples by
Maxwell and Coebergh (1986) and Colhoun (1988) confirm such an
analysis.   Maxwell and Coebergh (1986) found a moderately
high correlation (r = .56) between a scale measuring
"satisfaction with relationships" and a "loneliness" score
derived from a modified version of the UCLA Loneliness scale
(Russell, Peplau &amp; Cutrona, 1980).   Loneliness was most
commonly an outcome of major life changes (including new jobs,
new loves, travel and retirement), the loss of close
relationships (through death, divorce, illness or moving) and
isolating circumstances (spouse and family away, shift work or
isolated living).   All these events can be viewed as
affecting close relationships or making them more difficult to
maintain.   Three other common reasons also relate to the
pattern of social relationships, namely having unhappy close
relationships, getting married or being at home with young
children.   Thus in at least 78% of the cases in the Maxwell
and Coebergh study, the events which precipitated the
loneliest periods in people 's lives can be seen as those that
have affected the pattern of their relationships with
others.  
    Colhoun (1988) surveyed 101 people drawn at random
from the Dunedin electoral rolls.   Her data shows a
correlation of r = -.59 between a scale to measure
"satisfaction with relationships" and a shortened version of
the loneliness scale used by Maxwell and Coebergh.  
    It can be suggested that a "wellness" concept of
satisfaction with relationships is preferable to the
"illness" concept of loneliness and that, like the
relationship between depression and wellbeing, a "satisfaction
with relationships" scale allows for differentiation among
the satisfied while "loneliness" scores tend to discriminate
more strongly among the dissatisfied.  
    It is not only the correlations between scale scores
that support an analysis of loneliness as being part of a more
general concept of relationship satisfaction.   Maxwell
and Coebergh found the best predictors of loneliness were: how
satisfied people felt with their close relationships (r =
.56)&semi; how close people felt to the closest person in their
life (r = .46)&semi; how many people they felt close to (r = .44)
and the amount of contact they had with people at work (r =
.28).   These four variables in combination account for
nearly half the variance (r = .69) in loneliness.   Thus
these findings clearly demonstrate the importance of close
relationships as opposed to just social contact, for feelings
of loneliness.   It is the quality of time spent with others
rather than the quantity which determines satisfaction with
social contact.   It is the closeness of relationships with
others rather than the number which determines satisfaction
with relationships.  
    Satisfaction with close relationships and satisfaction
with social contacts are suggested by Colhoun and Maxwell
(1986) as critical variables that predict mental health
variables.   The social satisfactions are determined by the
nature of social experiences and in particular, contacts with
close friends, number of close friends, closeness to the
closest person and the amount of contact with others during
leisure hours.   The Colhoun and Maxwell paper reports
correlations between loneliness, i.e., a lack of satisfaction
with close relationships, and self-esteem of r = -.38, between
loneliness and depression of r = .52, between loneliness and
social anxiety of r = .44 and as previously reported, a
correlation between loneliness and wellbeing of r =
-.52.  
        Summary and Discussion      
    The research reviewed here indicates that it is
possible to measure subjective wellbeing as an overall
estimate of life satisfaction and as a balance of positive and
negative affect.   Subjective wellbeing is not an artefact
of mood or social desirability.   It is closely correlated
with depression but is a more effective measure as it
discriminates better amongst the non-depressed.   It varies
in response to major life changes such as marital separation
or unemployment.  
    Two other variables emerge as closely linked with
wellbeing but not identical to it.   Both self-esteem and
satisfaction with interpersonal relationships fulfil the
criteria of measures of psychological health in being
demonstrably related to human psychological and social
wellbeing, able to be measured in a global manner, able to be
measured reliably and useful in the sense of being responsive
to major changes in life circumstances.  
    Both self-esteem and satisfying interpersonal
relationships could be regarded as antecedents of subjective
wellbeing, as the latter is the more general concept and
subsumes aspects of the other two in the way in which it is
measured.   We would not disagree with such a proposal at
the general theoretical level but would argue that, at a
practical level, independent measurement of self-esteem
and satisfaction with relationships is highly desirable.
  The studies reviewed here show that certain events impact
more directly on self-esteem (e.g., body image and work
successes) and satisfying relationships (e.g., contact
with close friends and leisure activities).   The
development of a model which views psychological health as
being assessed through subjective scales which are responsive
to objective life conditions and capable of being mediated by
empowering interventions, demands a multi-faceted
conceptualisation of psychological health.   Self-esteem and
satisfying interpersonal relationships will often be the
more direct goal of intervention programmes than global
wellbeing.  
      Another argument for including measures of
self-esteem and relationship satisfaction in psychological
health batteries, is the demonstrable damage brought about by
the events that cause disruption to relationships and loss of
self-esteem.   Also, the association between depression and
suicide and the loss of self-esteem and close relationships
has been amply documented.   Thus self-esteem and effective
interpersonal relationships are appropriate primary goals for
mental health promotion.  
    It could also be suggested that although self-esteem
and satisfying relationships have been identified as
critical aspects of wellbeing, there may also be others.
  We concur with Rodin and others (1982) in acknowledging
the importance of coping skills which should quite rightly
be the proximate targets of intervention programmes.   It is
possible that a generalised measure of coping skill could be
developed, validated, and added to the battery we propose.
  Other possibilities also exist.   Perhaps power and
knowledge are important.   On the other hand, research to
date has failed to demonstrate that these domains make an
impact on subjective wellbeing for most people.   Thus it
does not seem appropriate to select such criteria as the goals
of mental health prevention and promotion or the
interventions of a community psychologist.  
    Thus it is proposed that a scale to measure
psychological health can be derived from measures of
wellbeing, satisfaction with relationships and self-esteem.
  Scales used in the New Zealand research reviewed here can
be obtained from the authors.       

        A Vision of Apocalypse    
      I  N THE SKY above Otahuhu the moon turned
to blood.  
    Otahuhu in 1962 was a township half an hour 's drive
from the city of Auckland where, a law student not yet twenty
years old, I lived with my parents, brother and sisters,
brought up on the extraordinary prophecies of the   Book of
Revelation   but not expecting their fulfilment in my
lifetime.   As I walked from the bus stop to my home on a
cold winter evening I saw an eerie lightening of the sky.
  Beams of light radiated from the northern horizon and
intersected with each other through the blackness of the
night.   I climbed to the open balcony on the first floor of
the old house and was arrested with awe as the sky pulsated
with these brilliant shafts of light.   They were red and
white.   They extended across the night like the ribs of a
fan.   They were spinning, they were intermingling.
  The sky was diffused with a ghastly brush of red.   It
was an unnerving spectacle.  
    For all that I told myself it was unlikely that divine
judgment was to be visited on the people of Otahuhu, I
couldn't reason away the chill sweat of dread.   I had seen
in the South Island of New Zealand the majesty of the aurora
australis.   What I saw that night came from the wrong pole.
  The intensity of light and colour was far more extreme.
  But as the minutes passed, it dawned on me that I had not
been promoted to glory.   No fundamentalist rapture had
taken place.   I was still affected by gravity and composure
crept back.   I reverted to my usual dismissal of divine
phenomena.   After about a quarter of an hour the lights
died away.  
    Eventually the radio told us what had happened.
  Thousands of miles north-east of New Zealand, the United
States had tested a one-megaton nuclear weapon at high
altitude by launching it on a rocket and exploding it two
hundred miles above Johnston Island in the Pacific.   The
device had been laced with millions of copper threads.
  They danced in the ionosphere and ruptured the ordered
magnetic fields, which, in spasmodic correction of the
violation, created a nuclear aurora.  
    For me the technical explanation made things worse.
  The confusion in the sky that night haunted me as a vision
of a man  -  made apocalypse, a terrifying retaliation of
natural forces against the evil of unnatural invasion and a
warning that a small country at the edge of the world in the
South Pacific was no longer far enough away from the quarrels
of the great powers to escape their consequences.   It was a
shock to realise that the power of nuclear weapons could
straddle the world and unleash a threat on an inoffensive
country like New Zealand.  
    New Zealand in 1962 was a place apart.   My father,
a doctor with a passing interest in novelties and a watcher of
planes landing at the local airfield, hadn't bought a
television set.   There wasn't a lot of point.   When
television arrived there was one channel in the evenings only,
in grainy black and white.   There were no private radio
stations.   The government owned and ran a commercial and a
non-commercial radio network.   The bars closed at six in
the evening and stayed closed all day on Sunday.   Every
session of the cinema began with a grand rendition of the
British national anthem played by a British military band on
the soundtrack of a film that showed the Queen riding
side-saddle in military attire at the Trooping of the Colour
in London.   Unquestioningly the audience stood when the
first drumroll of the anthem sounded.  
    Just in front of our family house was a small
triangular park containing two monuments.   The first, an
obelisk of sandstone, commemorated a man who died a century
before, twelve thousand miles from his English home,
trying to disposess the native Maori people of their property.
  The second monument was the war memorial.   A
magnificently cast horse bearing a fully kitted-out cavalryman
was mounted on a large concrete plinth on the sides of which
were bronze plaques recording the sacrifices made between 1914
and 1918.   Once a year, on 25 April, the people of Otahuhu
gathered around the war memorial for the Anzac Day
service.  
    More sacred than any Sunday, Anzac Day was named for
the Australia and New Zealand Army Corps and marked the
slaughter these men were consigned to at Gallipoli in 1915.
  The war they fought in not having ended all wars, the day
of their tragedy became a memorial to all who died while
serving New Zealand abroad.  
    My earliest solemn memories are of the Anzac Day
services at Otahuhu.   The main road south from Auckland,
the Great South Road, was closed, and the streets filled with
the townsfolk.   The veterans marched on.   Schoolteachers
and the local grocer and barber looked very different one day
a year, bedecked with medals.   The Salvation Army band led
the hymn singing.   The mayor intoned a remembrance.   The
bugler played the Last Post.   The guard of honour from the
local school cadet unit fired three volleys of blanks.   The
less sensitive of the children ran through the ranks gathering
the spent cartridges.   I only did it once&semi; my father
thought it poor form.   Reveille sounded and the
wreath-laying began.  
    This part of the ceremony was hard to take.   It was
not the official tributes that churned me up - it was seeing
the mothers of school friends placing homegrown bunches of
flowers against the base of the memorial in memory of the
fathers my friends had never seen.   Each year I saw an old
woman place two blooms against the monument, one for her
brother killed at Gallipoli and the other for her son killed
nearly thirty years later in Egypt.  
    There were hundreds of people at the Anzac Day
service.   They all knew each other.   I knew most of them
and they knew me because everyone knew the doctor 's family.
  It was a good time and place to grow up in.   Although I
was the doctor 's son and we lived in a big house, I went to
the same schools as everyone else, talked like everyone else
and felt at home in any house in Otahuhu.   It was that sort
of a town.   The plumber probably earned as much as my
father.   Otahuhu had no unemployment.   Hardly anyone was
out of work in New Zealand.   It was a rich little country
and there didn't seem to be an awful lot to worry about.  
    Otahuhu was no place for a nuclear aurora and its
intrusion shattered my complacency.   The nuclear afterglow
persuaded me that my country was not a Noah 's ark.   There
would be no lucky survivors and no shelters deep enough if the
world went mad.   I was struck by the conviction that the
planet 's future depended on our eliminating any possibility of
nuclear war.    
    Having reached this conclusion, I was unsure how to
act on it.   New Zealand had a military alliance with the
United States, a nuclear power, but nuclear weapons played no
immediate part in our defence.   We were always a bystander.
  Opposition to nuclear testing could only be a show of
feeling.   There wasn't a clear target for our resistance.
  Our impotence was plain when, in the year the nuclear
aurora shone on Otahuhu, France announced that it was moving
its atmospheric nuclear weapons testing programme from the
Sahara Desert to its island territories in the South Pacific.
  My concepts of distance were not then tempered by the
experience of travel, and I assumed that testing on the atolls
of Tahiti was testing next door to New Zealand.   My
new-found fear of nuclear destruction was fuelled by
xenophobia.   The South Pacific was ours, not a laboratory
for the powers of the Northern Hemisphere.   I remember
self-righteously feeling how extraordinarily grovelling
Australia was to allow nuclear weapons to be tested on their
soil by the British.   What the French, and the Americans,
were doing in the Pacific seemed to me to be an affront to the
independence of New Zealand.  
    I didn't join the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament or
any other group formed to protest against nuclear testing.
  It was through my law studies that I was drawn into the
small active protest movement.   I worked part-time through
most of my law degree and in 1962 I got a clerk 's job with
Haigh, Charters and Carthy, barristers and solicitors of
Auckland.   In the early morning I went to lectures at
Auckland University, worked at the office through the day and
went to more lectures in the evening.   Haigh, Charters was
not a wealthy firm.   The office accommodation was dreadful.
  It had the austerity of a Non  -  conformist chapel.
  The workload of the practice was no more fashionable.
  The firm acted for most of Auckland 's trade unions.   It
was heavily involved in the legal defence of political
activists.   It was the legal comforter of the artistic and
literary community.   Haigh, Charters was an exciting firm
to work for if you didn't want to build yourself a reputation
among the moneyed classes.  
    Frank Haigh, the senior partner, was one of Auckland 's
leading advocates.   He represented the maimed, the defamed,
the dissenting and the dispossessed.   Les Charters was the
second senior partner.   He was a great lawyer.
  Disqualified from practice and imprisoned for some years
during the war because of his conscientious objection to
military service, he declined to take the oath of allegiance
to allow him to practise law again until 1958, when he was
sure he was no longer likely to be called up.   Jack Carthy,
a devout Catholic, made up the trio.   He was the general
practitioner of the team.   The agnostic Haigh was highly
catholic in his championing of the right to pursue a cause.
  He acted for a clutch of Christian pacifists, for the
Church of Scientology when it was the subject of a commission
of inquiry, and for the Communist Party of New Zealand.   Of
them all, the last stood lowest in popular opinion.  
    The Communist Party carried a burden of contempt in
New Zealand as elsewhere in the days of the Cold War.   To
public acclaim the National Government in 1951 smashed the
waterfront union.   Some of its influential members were
communists&semi; the odium lingered and politicians raised the
bogey from time to time.   Most of the party 's few members
were sure they were being spied on.   Afraid that their
party would be outlawed and its assets confiscated, they spent
no small part of their income in devising trusts and other
legal shelters which would protect their property when the
government finally lived up to its threats and the axe fell on
them.  
    Under the guise of many names, the Communist Party set
itself to rouse public opinion against atmospheric nuclear
testing over the Pacific ocean.   My employer Frank Haigh
was a regular speaker at protest meetings organised by the
party in Auckland.   Just as my junior role in the office
required me to fetch Frank 's lunch, so I was called on to help
distribute the leaflets which denounced the testing and
announced the times of the rallies and marches.  
    I did not enjoy this part of my job.   I had no wish
to be labelled a 'com'.   I knew too that the limitation of
the protests to atmospheric testing in the Pacific let the
Russians off the hook.   But I thought enough of the cause
not to spurn support for it.   I used to puff my way up from
the office of Haigh, Charters to the squalid headquarters of
the Communist Party.   I remember the   frisson   of
apprehension I felt each time I entered.   I 'd heard enough
tales of surveillance to believe I was being watched.   Nor
was there anything within to attract.   Tucked away in a
seedy arcade, the office offered no welcome.   Neither did
the staff, who sat among piles of boring-looking books, stacks
of unsold party newspapers and always, in what seemed to me to
be a denial of doctrine, the weekly racing tip sheet,
  Best Bets  .   Gathering up my stock of handbills, I
left.   I delivered the leaflets, I marched in the rallies
and I went to the meetings.  
    The nuclear-free movement had an uphill struggle in
the early 1960s.   Although eighty thousand people signed a
petition in 1963 calling for an end to nuclear testing in the
Southern Hemisphere, there was nothing in New Zealand to
match the mass protests organised by the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament in Britain.   The marches here were poorly
attended&semi; we counted it a successful meeting when the numbers
reached the hundreds.  
    The United States had a test site at Christmas Island
in the Pacific.   It was bomb testing at Easter on Christmas
Island that led to the public protest meeting I now best
remember.   The blasphemous combination sparked more than
the usual interest.   The smaller of Auckland 's two town
halls was almost filled with trade unionists, the women
members of the League for Peace and Freedom, academics and a
heavier-than-usual representation from the churches.   The
speakers all denounced the testing and were dutifully
applauded.   There wasn't a lot of passion in it - the
audience had come convinced and needed no conversion.  
    The meetings never gave anyone much trouble.   The
police were not called on and the government was unmoved.
  Indeed, the gatherings probably gave comfort to the
authorities because of the small support they attracted.
  The Auckland morning paper could always be relied on to
alert its readers to the presence of communists among the
speakers.   While some were of Marxist leaning, most came
from the churches or had a background of humanitarian concern.
  Almost all those protesters I met reeked of sincerity and
goodness.   They were indulged by the authorities and
tolerated, even respected, by the wider public for their
standing in the community and for their record of good works.
  The cause itself and their commitment to it left small
impression.   They hadn't learned to lobby or to cobble
together any coalition of support.  
    The efforts of the Communist Party to make the
nuclear-free movement its instrument were dismally
unsuccessful.   I was too often the witness of its
insularity and incompetence to have any doubt of that.   Its
members lived as aliens in their own country, isolated and
ineffective.   The great irony is that the nuclear-free
movement in New Zealand was finally set alight not by the
efforts of the communists but by the actions of the Western
powers.  
    American intervention in Vietnam created the first
genuinely popular protest movement in New Zealand.   The
United States asked that its small but undeniably respectable
ally make a show of support by taking part in the war.   The
National Government complied.   The war served no obvious
New Zealand interest&semi; for the first time in its history the
country was involved in a conflict it was not unpatriotic to
oppose.   A protest movement emerged whose national pride
was obvious and whose sincerity was not easily questioned.
  It learned to test its powers of organisation and
persuasion against the government.   Any seditious or
communist elements were rapidly overwhelmed by the mainstream.
  Protesters abandoned the limitations of musty halls
and painfully duplicated circulars.   They took to the
streets, captured the churches, absorbed the universities.
  The papers were full of them.  
    The swelling tide of protest against New Zealand 's
involvement in the Vietnam War swept up the small
nuclear-free movement, absorbed its energies, and for the
time being obscured its aims.   But all the energy, idealism
and skill the protest movement had thrown up came very much to
a loose end when the war in Vietnam petered out.   The
movement was left, as it were, looking for a cause to
champion.  
    France in the meantime continued its programme of
nuclear weapons testing in the sky above Moruroa Atoll in the
South Pacific.   This was not the immediate focus of any
popular protest, although public concern about its harmful
effect was widespread.   There was in fact no reason for
protest.   In 1972 the National Government was defeated&semi; the
new Labour Government decided to capture the mood of the
country and become a protester itself by making a commitment
to international action against nuclear testing.   In a
striking move designed to focus world attention on the testing
at Moruroa, the government sent two of its small fleet of
frigates into the test zone.   A member of the Cabinet was
aboard one of them in July 1973 as the French tested a
five-kiloton weapon about twenty miles away, above the atoll.
  The gesture was reinforced when, together with Australia,
New Zealand challenged France at the International Court of
Justice at The Hague as to its right to explode nuclear
weapons in the atmosphere.   The case was adjourned when
France gave way to international opinion and announced that it
would in future carry out the tests below the surface of the
atoll.  
    The Labour Government 's next move was to set out to
win international support for the creation of a nuclear-free
zone in the South Pacific.   Its proposal was adopted in
principle at a meeting of the member countries of the South
Pacific Forum in July 1975 and received the endorsement of the
United Nations General Assembly later the same year.   But
that was as far as it went.   In November 1975 it was time
again for a general election.   Labour lost, the National
Party won, and no more was heard of the nuclear-free zone.  
    The Labour Government 's concern for the impact of
nuclear testing on the environment did not bring it into
direct conflict with the United States.   Conventionally
powered vessels belonging to New Zealand 's American ally
paid occasional calls at New Zealand ports.   Some of them
may have been nuclear-armed, but the possibility aroused no
public concern.   The visits of nuclear-powered vessels
would, in the climate of the time, have caused some
consternation, but none came calling.   Their absence was
not, for most of the government 's term in office, a cause of
friction.   It was not until 1975 that the United States
formally accepted legal liability for damage caused by
accidents involving its nuclear-powered vessels, and having
done so, once again expected its ally to welcome their
visits.  
    If the United States put pressure on the Labour
Government in its last few months in office to accept a
resumption of visits by nuclear-powered ships, I did not hear
of it.   I was the Labour Party 's candidate in the Hobson
electorate and was not in the confidence of members of the
government.   Hobson was a large rural electorate, far in
the north, and it was in the nature of New Zealand politics
that the Labour candidate was not going to win it.   For
most of the voters I was living evidence of the creeping
socialism the National Party warned about.   Yet curiously
enough, at the old settlement of Kerikeri there was one of the
nurseries of the nuclear-free movement.   Its warmth, its
music and dramatic societies and its acceptance of the exile
had made the town a magnet for the unorthodox.   Many faiths
prospered.   Among Anglicans and Methodists were gathered
Christian Scientists and Quakers and a smattering of old
Christian socialists.   Many among them had begun to
question the alliance between New Zealand and the United
States, with its underpinnings of nuclear ships and
nuclear weapons.   These pacifists of Kerikeri were very old
and very idealistic.   They were much given to prayer,
invocation and argument: the theistic equivalent of the
secular communists.   They did not reflect the mainstream of
New Zealand opinion about nuclear issues, and in that sense
the Hobson electorate perfectly reflected the whole of New
Zealand.  
      I was soundly beaten.   I went back to Auckland
and my legal practice.  
    Then there loomed on the horizon the prospect of
sudden death by nuclear explosion or lingering death by
leakage of nuclear radiation.   The newly victorious
National Government, led by red-baiting, round-headed Robert
Muldoon, ever anxious to win the favour of the United States,
invited the visit of the nuclear-powered cruiser USS
  Truxtun  .   Here was the spark that set alight the
protest movement.  
    When it was first understood that the United States
was anxious to resume its programme of visits by
nuclear-powered ships, a protest group was formed in Auckland,
calling itself the Peace Squadron.   Its guiding spirit was
a liberation theologian, the Reverend Dr George Armstrong.
  An engaging man of great vitality and considerable
scholarship, he invited the churches and the non-religious
peace groups to join him in mounting a marine protest.   The
Peace Squadron planned to use small boats to sail the channels
of Auckland Harbour and physically bar the way of the
intrusive nuclear technology.   So began a series of
water-borne demonstrations that were to mark the visit of
every nuclear-powered vessel.  
    I knew George Armstrong and many of his fellow
demonstrators through church activities, through my
brother, who took to the water to try to defeat the intentions
of the United States Navy, and through the potters and
artists, friends of my brother, who had decided to commit
themselves to protest against the visits of nuclear-powered
vessels.   Among them were many of those whose instinct for
protest as a political activity had been honed in the
demonstrations against the Vietnam War.   I made no attempt
myself to take part in the water-borne protests: although I 'm
fairly buoyant, I had no sailing experience.   But it was
understood that the demonstrators were going to find
themselves in confrontation with the police and that some
of them would need a legal defence.   I warmed to the
thought.  
    In October 1976, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier
USS   Long Beach   sailed towards Auckland.   It came
for what the Americans called rest and recreation.   If its
visit had any military purpose beyond the need to impress the
public with the destructive powers of our American ally, I
was not aware of it.   Nonetheless I resented its visit&semi;
I simply didn't like the presence in the harbour of nuclear
weapons.   The Peace Squadron gathered together a flotilla
of small craft and set out to sail across the narrow channel
down which the   Long Beach   must enter the
harbour.  
    On the morning of its arrival there was a flurry of
activity.   The harbour authority had designated certain
areas off limits and dispatched its vessels, its officers and
the police on board, to make sure the channel was cleared.
  Small boats darted across their path.   In the shadow of
Rangitoto Island at the entrance to the harbour, dwarfing its
opponents and its guardians both, bulked the   Long
Beach  .   Into the fray set off the yacht
  Dolphin  , captained by its owner Phil Amos, once a
minister in the Labour Government.     Dolphin  
sailed up the channel towards the advancing   Long
Beach  , then Phil turned his yacht around and motored
slowly down the channel back to Auckland, the vast vessel
looming ever closer behind him.   Not long after he made his
turn the police intervened&semi; the   Dolphin   was
shepherded out of the channel and captain and crew were taken
on board the police launch.      
  

        THAT SHRINKING FEELING    
  cartoon  
      W  HEN DINAH MEETS Roy in Carrie Fisher 's
new best-selling novel,   Surrender the Pink  , they get
straight to the point.   Not sex.   Psyche-peeping.
  Dinah 's big hang-up - and Steven Spielberg has just paid
US$1 million for the screen rights to this - is that she keeps
falling for men who are "approval withholders".   Writes
Fisher:   "This is why Dinah was bad with men ... when
she was very little, about two, her father went
away."    
    Roy has emotional problems with his girlfriend.
    "The bad thing,"   he tells Dinah,
  "is that if she 's f****** someone else, I 'll get
artificially hotter for her and I don't want to force her into
a life-long relationship where she has to keep having sex with
other people to keep me interested in her."    
    It 's hard to avoid the feeling that what these people
need is some Primal Shrug therapy, or at the very least a
course on How to Overcome Self-doubt Through Simple Pretense
and Ostentation.   It 's also hard to avoid the voyeuristic
feeling that this is all a thinly veiled version of Fisher 's
own diary.   It 's the same with   Postcards from the
Edge  , the novel on which the Meryl Streep movie is based.
  Here, Fisher 's central character, Suzanne, has been
through addiction therapy (just like Fisher) and displays a
whole new set of hang-ups.   As she tells her shrink:
  "What worries me is, what if this guy is really the
one for me and I haven't had enough therapy to be comfortable
with having found him?"    
    What to do?   What to do?   Fisher, who at times
appears to be one of those SICK (successful, intelligent,
coherent and knowledgeable) people who like to think they have
an odd id, did what 40 percent of all Americans are now
reported to do - she got the problem analysed.   Even the
English are doing it: John Cleese has had "an association"
with family therapist Robin Skynner since the mid-70s, when
his first marriage broke up.   Together, they 've written the
best-selling   Families and How to Survive Them   and
are now releasing a six-part radio programme dealing with such
questions as,   "Why do people decide to marry each
other?"     Skynner answers that a person is often
attracted to someone of similar background who has missed the
same stage of development - because of an absent father,
perhaps, or that old bogey "excessive mothering".   Therapy
didn't prevent Cleese 's second marriage from breaking up.
  But he has now found happiness with - yup - a
psychotherapist.  
    Even those who don't want it get psychoanalysed.
  The punks, with their black leathers and studs, T-shirts
printed with images of rape and murder, and artificially torn
and soiled clothing intended all this as a decent,
self-respecting attempt to shock and offend.   Psychologists
saw it as a demand, not just for attention but for love and
care.   They pointed to the damaged baby-indicators: the
hairless heads, pale faces, scraped knees, torn jeans,
ill-fitting, half-undone jackets and leggings.   The dog
chains that often linked one leg to another gave the wearer
the short, halting, appealing gait of a toddler.   And the
outsize safety-pin motif simply reinforced the baby image.  
    There are just so many   rules   now.   We all
have to be active listeners, although the subscript to "I
hear what you 're saying" has now become "and I violently
disagree with you so I 'm using this phrase as a condescending
put-down".   Neuro-linguistic programming forbids the use of
one 's normal visual mode - "I   see   what you mean, I
get the   picture  " - when someone tries to communicate
in kinetic terms: "Things   feel   real   heavy  
man, it 's just like I can't   handle   it any more."  
    We can't be road warriors any more:
"    Outa    Out of     my way, sucker." We 're now
road   worriers  , wondering whether the fact that we
sometimes sort of accidentally go slow in the fast lane or at
the lights is evidence of "Passive Aggressive Procrastinator
Syndrome": provoking and irritating other drivers as a sign of
displaced aggro.   And transactional analysis means you
can't even say, "If it weren't for you" to a partner, because
it probably means that you deliberately picked a domineering
mate who prevents you from doing things you were too scared to
do anyway.    
    Sportspeople, for whom a session on the couch once
referred to the after-match party, are now into "positive
visualisation" and understanding that temper or tanking
(withdrawing emotional involvement and effort) are both simply
means to avoid the unpleasant emotions of nervousness and
fear.  
    And as for all the pop-psychology books around, well,
Auckland psychologist Barry Kirkwood sees them as generally
positive.   The Gestalt, TA and Rational Emotive therapies
were first picked up 30 years ago by people like Dale Carnegie
and have now been joined by a plethora of methods right
through to New Age communing-with-dolphins therapists.
  Many books, says Kirkwood, are similar to evangelical
Christianity: they involve personal testament, positive
affirmation and also have a moral component: to be successful
you have to believe that what you 're doing is right.   Many
are just like sales-training programmes: there 's goal-setting,
monitoring, positive role-modelling, positive visualisation
and positive reinforcement.   Kirkwood:   "It 's all
good, optimistic stuff.     It 's all, 'So what if your
father left when you were two, wow, the same thing happened to
me and I used behaviour modification and look at me
now.'  "    
    Not all
    pyschologists    psychologists     agree with
him.   In   Understanding Psychology  , Ken Richardson
points out that   "...psychology is in a bit of a mess
at the moment, full of self-doubt about its aims and
objectives,   disagreeable   about what is currently
'good' psychology..."   (my italics).   Richardson
maybe meant to write "disagreeing" there.   I think it 's
what you call a Freudian slip. Therapy, perhaps?    
        SOCIALISM? NO THANKS, WE'RE
GREENIES    
  photo  
    The green movement is reformist and middle class.
  JOHN STEWART argues that unless it captures the
imagination and involvement of the working class it will have
little political impact.  
    Green politics has many mansions.   Its spectrum
ranges from extreme individualistic anarchism to the
eco-socialism of a section of the German Greens&semi; from
"clip-on" environmentalism to ecologism, from value-oriented
conservatives, to the last fragments of the socialist Left.
  To cover the possibilities and label them, European Greens
have taken to talking in terms of "pale Greens", "mid Greens",
and "dark Greens".   The blight of semantic death has moved
from the committee meetings of the "old Left", into the
gatherings of the Greens.  
    In this country the eco-socialists of the Values
Party, the world 's first green party, were smothered and
eventually suffocated by an alliance of 1970 's liberal
trendies and the flower power of the "alternative life
stylers".   These two groups independently held the view
that the capitalist system should not, or could not be
challenged.   The "alternative life stylers" withdrew into a
haze of pot-induced communal bliss, and suggested that this
provided the answer to the problems of alienation in the
working environments of a capitalist "democracy".  
    The liberal trendies personified by Messers Clough and
Kunowski (Values Party leaders 1974-79), despite using vaguely
socialist rhetoric, really believed that it was possible to
civilise the dominant capitalist enterprises and protect the
environment by persuasion -- or if that didn't work, by
legislation.   Ultimately many of these people flirted with
Bob Jones and the New Zealand Party and then moved to become
cheer leaders for Rogernomics, the current ideology of the
Labour Government.   Some can now be seen and heard
addressing right-wing "think" tanks such as the Mont Pelerin
Society.  
    In 1990 the re-emerging "Green" movement in New
Zealand appears to consist predominantly of people searching
for an environmentally benign life style.   In Christchurch,
greenies spend a lot of time "getting attuned", focussing, and
metaphorically holding hands.   There is also evidence to
suggest that the Christchurch Green network is in the process
of being hijacked by Labour Party Greens determined to focus
on the symptoms and not the underlying causes of the
ecological crisis.   Both Labour and National Party "greens"
are a living contradiction in terms.   Both groups have
agendas, driven by election considerations.   Political
opportunism is their hallmark&semi; the achievement or retention of
power their objective.  
    In Wellington, it appears as if a very small group of
busy and opportunistic "real" green politicians are attempting
to launch a Green political style party -- a party without any
socialist overtones.   One of the members of this group,
Stephen Rainbow, in the various academic papers he has written
on the Values Party, consistently attacks what he calls the
Christchurch socialists in that party during the 1974-79
period (Rainbow is a Wellington City Councillor).  
    Further north the Green movement has failed to
re-emerge in any coherent or visible way.   Small groups of
people pursuing green-type objectives -- protecting "old"
buildings, and protesting specific environmental spoliation
issues -- are active, but an overtly green movement is still
to appear.   Various Green micro parties are probably in
existence, but from this distance their activities are not yet
discernable.  
    Nationally, a coherent politically sophisticated New
Zealand Green Party could emerge, but not for at least two or
three years.   Greens are presently on a learning curve and
have some considerable distance to travel.   The problems
they face are a general public antipathy to politics and
politicians, a politically illiterate constituency, and the
conservative and timid attitudes of an as yet mainly
middle-class membership.   Until the Green movement becomes
more than an vehicle for an element of the professional middle
class it will languish eccentrically on the margins of New
Zealand society.   It has to capture the imagination and
involvement of the proletariat -- both working and unemployed.
  It has to become an expression of active people power,
political but not
    convential    conventional    , on the
streets, in the local community, and in the work place.   To
be effective the Green movement has to   help   to
promote and create a countervailing hegemony to the prevailing
culture, conventions and mores of a capitalist society.
  Green candidates in the 1990 elections could help this
process but would not be a substitute for it.   
      THREAT    
    Currently the major threat to the Green movement is to
be found in a mainly middle-class and socially conditioned
misconception that environmentalism provides the key to
establishing and maintaining a sustainable society, not
dramatically dissimilar from the present situation.   In
this respect the foundation members of the world 's first Green
Party, Values, in 1972 were significantly more advanced in
their thinking than their 1990 successors.   Influenced by
the findings of the "Club of Rome", they recognised that there
are limits to growth, both in terms of natural resource
utilisation, pollution, environmental spoliation, and the
social fall-out of the technological revolution.   By the
mid-  70 's a Christchurch-based group of Values members
had begun to formulate a socialist response to this developing
ecological crisis.   They suggested that industrial and
technological processes are the fundamental cause of the
environmental, social, and overriding ecological threat.
  As green socialists appreciated, plundering the planet
also involved plundering people.   The competitive ethos led
to concentrations of power and wealth: the computer based
revolution would wipe out millions of jobs world-wide, and
that as a consequence labour-cost saving would produce
mounting and massive unemployment.  
    These predictions have been realised.   Capitalism 's
inevitable winners and losers syndrome has led in this
country, as elsewhere, to closures, mergers and takeovers,
unemployment, economic decline and social decay.
  Nevertheless the crisis of capitalism did not lead to
radical and progressive change&semi; a sweeping away of the system.
  Capitalism will not miraculously transform itself into
"green-socialism" simply because some senior executives and
managers recognise the physical limits to growth.  
    The motor force of capitalism remains the drive for
profit and individual organisation growth in a competitive
environment.   If that environment is threatened by
ecological realities, intelligent capitalists will combine to
set legislative boundary fences to ensure the survival of
their system.   Laws will be made, designed to punish the
polluters, and protect against environmental degradation.
  The move to "clip-on environmentalism" is a clear
indication that this trend is already in motion.
  Unfortunately the majority of Greenies in New Zealand have
been conned by the media and smooth-talking academics into
endorsing and advocating the environmentalist response.
  Campaigns against wasteful product packaging are visible
expressions of this political strategy.  
    The consequences of "clip-on environmentalism" will be
horrendous, because clearly this approach does not address the
underlying causes of the growing ecological crisis.
  Certainly pollution controls will eventually prevail.
  These controls will increase the cost of production
methods, make industrial organisation more capital-intensive,
reduce labour costs by introducing new technology, and the
synergistic effect of these various strategies will be to
create more inequality and more poverty.   Many
transnationals are, in addition, already exporting pollution,
industrial waste, and environmental degradation to the
low-wage economies of Asia, Africa, and central and South
America.   Eco-fascism becomes a real and immediate
possibility in this scenario.  
    In contrast, true ecologists examine the reasons why
certain technologies, production processes and consumption
patterns were promoted and developed initially.   In
capitalist countries,   "... these reasons have to do
with the logic of capitalist accumulation: increasing amounts
of capital need to be invested profitably, which in turn
requires an increasing flow of commodities and an increasing
consumption of raw materials and energy."   (Andre Gorz
interview,   New Statesman and Society   12 May 1989).
  In brief it is the   logic   of the capitalist
system which leads to ecological mayhem -- to pollution,
environmental spoliation, social breakdown and the consequent
incoherence and alienation, characteristic of western
industrial/commercial societies.   Eastern European
"communist" societies of course also pursued industrial growth
strategies with very serious environmental and social
consequences.   Nevertheless in these countries the drive
for power and status was extrinsic to industrialism unlike
capitalist economies where the profit motive is intrinsic and
endemic in the system.  
    Institutional and organisational responses to these
environmental and social problems are leading to tighter
controls, autocratic management styles, high levels of
structural unemployment, increasing labour casualisation and
unsustainable alienation.
  quote  
  Attempts to put a gloss on these developments by indulging
in the rhetoric of "worker participation", "industrial
democracy" and "quality circles" merely conceal manipulative
techniques designed to maintain hierarchical management
control systems.   Such semantic adventures help to create a
work environment in which workers cheerfully acquiesce in
their own exploitation.   Obviously this illusion cannot be
maintained indefinitely.  
    As we have seen in the 1970 's, and again in the late
1980 's, a small group of eco-socialists recognised that an
appropriate and relevant response needed to be made to the
developing ecological crisis.   They called for a resumption
of the "long march" through the institutions of capitalism.
  They called for the sweeping away of the system.   They
demanded that the people must be empowered.   Consequently
these "green-socialists" advocated the democratising of the
workplace, decentralisation, and the break-up of the centres
of political and economic power.   Significantly
green-oriented socialists understand that the motor of
profit-driven capitalism must be disconnected, if the
environment is to be protected and ecological balance and
harmony restored.  
    Those socialists in New Zealand who grew out of the
Values Party experience of the 1970 's are understandably
sceptical, therefore, of the validity of the current position
of the new wave of "greenism".   Legislative tinkering with
the system seems totally removed from their vision of the
future.   They see a society in which there is scope for the
human spirit to roam free in conditions of relative abundance
and collective responsibility.   Like all true radicals
before them they go to the root of the matter.  
    Apart from a few, mainly survivors of the 1970 's, the
"new wave" of Greens are either proponents of the
technological or legislative "fix", or mystics seeking refuge
in a personal nirvana called the green lifestyle -- a sort of
religious escapism: a hand-in-hand withdrawal from engagement
with the real world.  
    In 1990 we are witnessing the 1970 's revisited.
  All the old "green" strands are in evidence.   All the
old arguments, antagonisms and conflicts within the "green"
movement are resurfacing.   A concentration on spirituality
may illuminate a personal vision, but that vision will remain
an unattainable fantasy, without collective political action
at all levels in society, and an acceptance of social
responsibility.   Hopefully, the harsh realities of living
in a decaying and increasingly capitalistic autocratic nation&semi;
a society in which big brother rules supreme, may well bring
about a melding of the various green currents, and the
development of a coherent, self-disciplined political
movement.   Such an outcome would take at least two or three
years.   With this objective in view let the
consciousness-raising activities of the "green" socialists
continue with even greater urgency, because time is running
out.    
  

          BUILDING THE POVERTY PRISON      
    The National government 's benefit cuts will put the
poor and needy on a subsistence level with little hope of
escape - even though there are other areas of state spending
where big savings could be made.  
      T  HE POVERTY TRAP, the New Right
insist, is an evil, debilitating thing.   Sated with welfare
dollars, the poor are suspected of losing their urge to
compete and are said to be turning up their noses at genuine
job offers.   In acting to close the poverty trap, however,
the government is creating something worse: the poverty
prison.  
    The signs are clear: convicts in New Zealand jails are
fed on a budgeted $3.87 a day, or $27 a week.   When the
experts in Treasury sit down to decide how much money is
enough for other people to live on, they usually multiply the
basic food budget 
  illustration  
by four - and this total budget is supposed to be enough to
meet all the costs of living, food included.   Do this to
the   convicts'   $27 a week food budget and you get $108
- the   precise   figure set by the government as the
new dole figure for 18- to 25-year-olds.  
    This is almost an invitation to steal your daily
bread, rather than try to earn it.   Prisoners have some
cost advantages: their food is bought cheaply in bulk, and a
team of nutritionists ensure that prisoners eat healthy,
balanced diets.   No such luck for the young.
  Law-abiding young people seeking work will - on the new
benefit levels - be extremely lucky if they can afford the
same sort of food they could get in jail.  
    The example shows just how far New Zealand has gone
from the position expressed in the 1972 Royal Commission
on Social Security, which urged that benefits should be set so
that   "everyone is able to enjoy a standard of living
much like that of the rest of the community, and thus is able
to feel a sense of participation and belonging to the
community"  .   The new benefits do the reverse.
  They ensure that the poor and their children will barely
subsist - like prisoners - out beyond the margins of normal
society.  
    The National government did no research to test
whether real people   could   live on the new benefit
levels.   The issue of income adequacy surfaces in the
Treasury briefing paper to the new government (p106 onwards)
and is treated in greater depth in the influential draft paper
by Treasury researchers Edith Brashares and Maryann Ansley.
  Both documents cite the basic household budgets prepared
by the Otago University food marketing research unit.   In
its March 1990 survey, the unit concluded that an adult male
could be fed adequately on $32.05 a week, or $4.58 a day.
  With strict budgeting the food plan estimates that a solo
mother and her child can be fed on $31.03 a week -
astonishingly, this assumes that a healthy child needs only
$1.27 of food a day!  
    The Otago budgets make grim reading: anyone condemned
to live on them would find their only luxuries forever more
would be an occasional spreading of jam, and sugar in their
tea.   It is   only   a food budget&semi; other income
would have to be found to pay for frivolities like soap,
shampoo, washing powder, toothpaste or tampons.   Prices
have also risen about five percent since these costings were
done.  
    Even so, these Otago figures come out remarkably close
to where some of the new benefit levels have been set:
multiply that precious $32.05 food budget by four in the usual
Treasury way and you get very near the new dole level of
$129.81.   It is an utterly arbitrary process&semi; as Treasury
says on page 106 of its briefing paper:   "... some
sources consider it is adequate to multiply by three, others
consider five is a more fair figure."     Treasury has
in fact chosen a miserly extreme&semi; only a few US studies used
three, and the 1972 Royal Commission used five to set its
benefit levels.   The health, living standards and life
chances of thousands of New Zealanders and their children
depend on such whims.  
    And does Minister of Social Welfare Jenny Shipley
think that in 1991 you can feed yourself adequately on $32.05
a week?   Shipley:   "I think that is in the ballpark
of what is adequate."     When one   "builds in
a factor"   like having a vegetable garden, she says,
things vary.     "Quite frankly, the research I
rely on is the marketplace.   If the marketplace cannot pay,
there is no such thing as an arbitrary, isolated, adequacy
level."    
    The whole subject of living standards is one she
treats as a rhetorical question:   "In terms of
adequacy, what is adequate for a family?"     She
shrugs.   An administrative matter, really.
    "We had to make judgments on the whole package
as to where we would pitch the
levels."      
      I  N DEFENDING the benefit cuts, the
government has taken pains to suggest it had no choice.
    "Like the rest of New Zealand,"   Prime
Minister Jim Bolger says,   "the government cannot go on
spending money it does not have."     If left
unchecked, the financial deficit was set to rise to $3.7
billion in 1991-2, and up to $5.2 billion in 1993-4.
  Bolger 's claim is that we cannot continue to fund what he
describes as one of the world 's most generous welfare systems
while the New Zealand economy remains one of the worst
performers in the developed world.  
    This argument (There Is No Alternative) was one of the
central dogmas of Rogernomics - even though the rest of the
world had largely abandoned their monetarist experiments by
the time Roger Douglas began his.   The government, in fact,
continues to spend money it does not have when it sees fit: on
the Anzac frigates, on teacher subsidies to private schools,
and on the $2.018 million it currently uses to subsidise
Bellamys.   This means that the core clientele of Bellamys -
the 97 MPs - each get a taxpayer food and drink subsidy of
$400 a week, three times the new unemployment benefit.
  Using the Otago basic food plan calculations, that $2.018
million Bellamys subsidy would provide meals for 1211
beneficiaries for a year.  
    In other words, if the government wanted to save
money in other ways it could.   If it wanted to raise money
in other ways, it could.   Like the Labour government before
it, National refuses to trouble the wealthy with a capital
gains tax, common in most developed countries.   The benefit
cuts will save the government about $1 billion&semi; a tax on
capital gains cast as wide as the one in the United States
would bring in $1.5 billion in New Zealand&semi; an
Australian-size model would net $200 million.  
    There are even more efficient alternatives.   If
company and income tax for high-earners was put back up to
where it was between 1985 and 1988 - namely at 48 cents in the
dollar, not the current 33 cents - this would recoup $2.4
billion.   Would this sap our initiative?   Somehow, the
entrepreneur heroes of yesteryear managed to have a stock
market boom on a tax rate of 48 cents in the dollar.   Now,
amid a recession, a large hike in company tax would certainly
deal a blow to business as harsh as that now being felt by
beneficiaries.   Unfortunately, the benefit cuts themselves
are going to hit business hard, especially in regions like
Gisborne, Northland and the West Coast, where welfare
dollars are a crucial part of the local economy.  
    Beneficiaries, after all, spend their money on goods
within the local community - they don't tend to import cars
from Japan, or to invest overseas.   Taking $1 billion from
their budgets will further flatten the demand side of the
economy and cause more job losses - a process likely to
accelerate once this year 's budget also makes the wealthy set
aside money to pay for their own social services.   In
rejecting a "borrow and hope" policy, the government seems to
have chosen a "strangle and hope" option.  
    Shipley is undaunted by the prospect.
    "Though no one 's done the figures"   she
senses that the spending money taken out of the economy in
benefit cuts could be balanced -   "closer than many
people realise"   - by the subsequent one percent fall
in mortgage interest rates.   So is she saying that if the
poor are being made to suffer, at least they 're helping the
middle class pay off their mortgages?   You would be
surprised, Shipley says, just how many lower class people
have mortgages.   To date, no exporters have thrown their
hats in the air in celebration and rushed to invest because of
the one percent fall in interest rates - and even this puny
advance seems likely to be wiped out as this year 's business
tax take has plummeted, due to the recession.  
    No one seems to have done the figures either on
whether the benefit cuts are likely to cause an increase in
crime.   Given that people will have less money coming in
legitimately to live on from the state, will they be
forced to resort to crime?   Shipley:   "I have no
idea.     You will need to talk to the people who may be
in that position.  "    
    But in setting benefits at these levels surely she
must have some idea of the social fallout?   The government,
Shipley replies, sees unemployment as being one of the main
causes of social dislocation, including crime, suicide and
illness.   The unemployment trap, as it becomes entrenched,
strikes her as being   "not a good way to run a society
and we intend to turn that around.     There are difficult
decisions involved in doing it.  "    
    While we wait for unemployment to turn around,
Wellington Youth Aid constable Vicki Blake is saying that the
benefit cuts   themselves   will inevitably cause an
increase in crime.   Is she right?   Shipley:   "I
think you have to wait.     Ask me in three
  months'   time when I see the statistics, and I 'll be
able to say yes, there has been a
correlation.  "    
    So we carry out social engineering, and then just wait
and see what happens?     "There is no social test you
can embark on,"   Shipley says defensively,
  "that will tell you tomorrow that if people have more
or less, they will or will not be likely to commit crime.
    They may well be.   I am not prepared to say they
will, because time will tell.  "     In this sense,
the benefit cuts are to be a great New Zealand social
experiment - the poor will be put under extreme pressure, and
the politicians will wait and see how much crime and
malnutrition then follows.  
  photo  
      T  HE CLAIM that New Zealand has one
of the most generous welfare systems in the world - one that
could stand a bit of cutting - rests on shaky ground.
  Scandinavian countries, Canada, and several European
welfare systems have notably more generous features.   Only
in our treatment of 60-plus citizens (now also facing the
knife) are we significantly generous.  
    To "prove" that even after the benefit cuts, New
Zealand beneficiaries would still be better off than
elsewhere, Bolger cites evidence that a solo mother with one
child is better placed (on 39.7 percent of the average wage)
than in Australia (with her benefit set at 28-30 percent of
the average wage).  
    One may well boggle at the "generosity" involved in
asking the New Zealand solo mother and her child to subsist on
less than two-fifths of the average bloke 's wage.   The
living standard and exemptions available to beneficiaries
across the Tasman also make a mockery of Bolger 's claim.
  The Aussie solo mother faces lower food costs and no GST&semi;
federal authorities in Canberra told me that she would not
have to pay prescription charges or   doctors'   fees, and
would also qualify for rates and car registration reductions.
  Aussie senior citizens pick up, in addition, greatly
subsidised travel (including one free trip within their state
a year), telephone subsidies, no TV licences, free spectacles
and other help.  
    Treasury, for its part, has always been a lot more
concerned with gaps closer to home.   The benefit cuts widen
the gap between benefits and wages, and all sorts of good
things are supposed to flow from that: those on benefits will
have an "incentive" to end their dependency on the state and
find a job&semi; the state will spend less on the poor&semi; wages will
fall as the beneficiaries underbid the low paid for jobs&semi; more
jobs will (cross fingers) be created ...   The vision is of
an upward spiral with a smaller and smaller role for the state
in paying for social welfare.  
    Reality, alas, begs to differ.   Wages have been
declining for a decade, while unemployment has gone up, not
down.   Despite New Right horror images of beneficiaries
grown soft on state hand-outs, there is no research evidence
that the work ethic has eroded in New Zealand: the problem is
that there are far too few or no jobs.   In the climate,
slashing $27 off the meagre income of a widow so she will have
an "incentive" to find work is grotesque.  
    Treasury dimly knows this to be true:   "Many
beneficiaries have little choice since, try as they
might,"   Treasury states on page 108 of the briefing
paper,   "no job is available."     This changes
at once back into their usual moralistic tone:
    "However, the rise in numbers and duration of
benefit is large, and if only one in ten beneficiaries have
been influenced in their decisions to remain on the benefit by
the benefits available, the cost is
substantial."      
    So just in case one in 10 is looking for a soft ride -
or one in a thousand, or one in 10,000 - almost all
beneficiaries are to be impoverished.   The state will save
money and   "the incentives to remain in, or form family
relationships, to accept work or make savings"   will be
enhanced.   Given less money, beneficiaries (ie, women) stay
married or get married.   Beneath the jargon lies an ancient
disdain for the moral fibre of the poor.   With a firm hand
they must be, in the words of the pat&eacute;-eating
puritans at Treasury,   "encouraged to look after
themselves"  .  
    Is the margin between benefits and wages such a major
problem?   Few workers should feel tormented by the thought
of others enjoying an easy life on the benefit.   At the
very most only about five percent of workers would get
  more   money on welfare - and few on welfare seem to
be turning down genuine offers of work.   Under the new
regime, anyone who turns down two job offers loses the benefit
for six months - but new Heretaunga MP Peter McCardle, in his
experience as an official with the Employment Service, found
that only a very small minority - about 4-5 percent - would
turn down two valid offers.   These were mainly, he says,
people on the dole with four or five children.  
    Finally, Social Welfare 's own research refutes the
notion that when benefits edge up on wages, people lose their
incentive to work.   In a 1988 study, C H Dominick and
others reported that an impressive 64 percent of solo mothers
in Sweden also do paid work outside the home, even though
their benefit is 94 percent of the average wage!   "This
suggests,"   say the researchers,   "that benefit
rates which are close to some wage rates do not necessarily
act as a disincentive to labour force participation.
    It appears that Swedish solo mothers do not require a
great financial incentive to take up employment, only the
opportunity to do so.  "    
      A  S TREASURY says, the benefit system
should be designed to make the poor   "maintain or form
family relationships"  .   The new benefit levels will
make it harder for women to leave violent or abusive
relationships - does Shipley feel guilty about that?
      "I don't think that 's true.   The benefit
levels are still very adequate ...   I have no doubt that
those in violent relationships who feel compelled to leave,
will leave.   The psychological evidence is that women stay
in violent relationships for reasons other than
money."      
    Under the new benefits regime, solo mothers must
present themselves as "work ready" as soon as their youngest
child turns seven, or lose their income.   So what happens
to that seven-year-old once school finishes for the day - or
during the school holidays - if the child 's mother can't
afford (or find) child care?  
    The new regime, it seems, may not be as draconian as
it sounds.   Shipley:   "The work test does not
require parents to be away from their children if they can
show the cost benefits of their earnings cannot cover that
risk."       No one,   she promises, will have
their benefits cut off when their child turns seven.
  People will be asked to look to the marketplace for their
future.       "The benefit will be there until you
take that step."       On paper, this looks like
business as usual: solo mothers already move quickly off the
DPB and - despite the hostility directed at solo mothers - the
DPB costs only three percent of social welfare spending and
accounts for only 4.6 percent of welfare fraud and abuse.  
    Similarly, Shipley has soothing words about the new
"stand down" provisions.   The bare outline indicates that
if someone leaves their job voluntarily or is dismissed, they
lose the dole for six months.   If, in other words, a young
worker is being sexually pressured by her employer, does she
have to wait to be attacked in order to prove her case - since
by leaving, she will have no income at all?  
    Apparently not.   Shipley has already instructed her
departmental staff that if there is any doubt why someone
left, they are to err on the side of the client, not the
employer.   In line with that, she has also had drafted an
instruction that it will not be necessary for charges of
sexual harassment to be filed against an employer before that
is taken as   "good and sufficient"   reason for
leaving a job.   There is no way   in hell,   Shipley
insists - striking a rather unlikely pose as champion of
  workers'   rights - that the stand down rules will be
allowed to give employers the chance to victimise their
staff.  
      T  HESE GLIMMERS of a more humane
approach are, however, rather token.   Shipley insists that
where real need exists, supplementary benefits will be made
available.   In taking that $1 billion from beneficiaries,
however, the government has put aside only some $25 million
for extra assistance.   Those first through the door and the
most articulate should mop that up fairly quickly.  
      Targeting the needy ignores a basic point: our
recent history of targeting benefits shows that relatively few
who qualify take them up.   This is mainly because the needy
simply never know the extra assistance exists&semi; others find
that the experience of applying for the main benefits (the
dole, the DPB) is so humiliating they do not go back to beg
for more.   The take-up rates for Guaranteed Minimum Family
Assistance, for instance, are reportedly below 50 percent.  
    Besides those who fall through the cracks, there is
the social resentment by the low paid.   There is evidence
that those in the community who resent beneficiaries reserve
their deepest hostility for the special needs grants and
supplementary assistance.   The benefit cuts, therefore,
will not only lock more of the needy in the poverty prison&semi;
they will increase the stigma for those who then have to beg
for help, and target social resentment against the
beggars.  
    The mood is one of belt tightening and hardship ahead.
  Bolger, in his Te Kuiti state of the nation speech last
month, lamented how few New Zealanders were ready to make the
sacrifices that were ahead.  
    There are, of course, overseas precedents for how the
sacrifices can be shared.   During the second oil shock the
prime minister of Japan was among those who took a 10 percent
wage cut.   Jenny Shipley 's   net   income per week is
over $1700 - at a time when she has cut the DPB plus family
support level for a solo parent with one child by $27, to
$227.   To match the sacrifices she is asking of others, how
does Shipley intend to change her personal lifestyle, so that
she can lead by example?  
    Shipley:   "Well, you 'll be aware that cabinet
did not take the pay increase this year.   That was a
forgoing of over $4000 per cabinet member.   Now I
understand that people on benefits could well be cynical about
that amount, considering the fact that the salary appears to
be very large.   But I think that you will find that in both
time and money, members of Parliament are nowhere near as well
off as they are perceived.   But quite frankly, that and
this issue [of benefit cuts] is   quite  
separate."        
  

    Fast Food for Fast Times    
    What lies behind the smiling face of Ronald
McDonald?   LINDSAY DAVIS examines the issues surrounding
McDonald 's, the world 's largest fast food
enterprise.    
    Ray Kroc, aged 52, kitchen paraphernalia supersalesman
from Chicago, wonders why Mac and Richard McDonald buy so much
equipment from his company.   Flies down to San Bernadino,
California.   A deal is struck and cash tills ring - a
meagre US$2.7 million.   Suddenly the same looking junk-food
parlours start dotting their course across the U.S.  
    But water is no boundary for these evangelists.
  Their desire to make new converts is stronger than any
makeup Tammy Baker could market.   Today the 'Golden Arches'
tentacles spread through 52 different countries.   From
Moscow (a recent convert) through Europe, Africa, Asia, the
Americas and the Pacific.   Every 17 hours a new McDonald 's
opens somewhere in the world, using up to 500 million pounds
of beef each day to feed its customers.   All of which
translates into yearly sales of over US$17 billion.
  (1)    (1)  reference      
    McDonald 's growth is all part of the
    corporations    corporation 's     tactical
manoeuvering along with its military style chain of command,
extensive public relations, million dollar advertising budget,
and cheap labour.   A labour pool that is uniformly dressed
and armed with rule books that talk about   "crew
members"   (employees) that   "man
stations"   (counters).   It 's all like a futuristic
giant cholesterol battleship whose mission is to smile and
sell before they 'kill'.  
    It 's classic stuff.   It reads like a Springsteen
song&semi; all the way along preaching about the American dream.
  Recently the     dreams    dream 's     edges
have become very cloudy, forcing the schizoid corporate giant
to slowly emerge     form    from     an
increasingly unsatisfying sleep.  
    RAINFORESTS    
    The hamburger is heavily implicated in the destruction
of forests throughout the world.   As United States demand
for meat grew, Western meat-buying firms began investing in
developing nations.   From the woodlands of Africa to the
rainforests of Central America the toll has been a recurring
pattern of deforestation, ruined soil, starving local
populations and an enriched small elite.  
    The destruction of rainforests in the Amazon Basin is
even more dramatic where bulldozing, burning and chemical
defoliation destroy immense tracts of forest each year.
  (2)    (2)  reference      
    In 1989 the crew of the spaceship   Discovery  
photographed a smoke cloud over the Amazon rainforest of a
million square miles.   Over Europe it would stretch from
London to Moscow.   In 1988 forest burning in the Amazon
region was responsible for roughly 20% of greenhouse gases
released.
  (3)    (3)  reference      
    Tropical forests are now disappearing worldwide at a
rate of 142,000 square kilometres a year through commercial
logging, cattle ranching and conversion to agriculture.   A
further 200,000 square kilometres are also seriously degraded
each year.   Teresa Apin adds:   "The result is not
only that forest people are dispossessed.   Plants and
animals are made extinct, floods and droughts follow, soil
erosion becomes widespread and the associated industries add
to global warming"  .
  (4)    (4)  reference      
    Within Central America two-thirds of its lowland and
lower montane rainforest has been cleared since 1950, at a
rate which continues at about 20,000 square kilometres a year.
  Ironically, out of 40 of the
    worlds    world 's     poorest countries 36
export food to the United States.
    (5)    (5)  reference      
  the footnote reference isn't actually there    
    McDonald 's, the largest fast food enterprise and the
largest buyer of beef in the world, denies, and always has
denied, that it has been involved with rainforest destruction
- aware not only of the environment lobby but also of U.S.
ranching and feedlot interests.  
    Burger King, the third largest chain in the global
junk-food business admitted that it had been buying 70% of
Costa Rica 's beef exports up until September 1987 when falling
sales and continuing demonstrations forced it to stop this
practice.
  (6)    (6)  reference      
    The tragedy is that Costa Rica is completely unsuited
for cattle farming.   The land on which cattle grazed had to
be created by clearing vast areas of forest.   Between
50,000 and 70,000 hectares of forest are destroyed annually to
provide short term pasture.   As a result one-third of the
    count    country     is now covered with
pasture or infertile scrub.
  (7)    (7)  reference      
    McDonald 's claims are very hard to substantiate or
disprove as in the U.S. meat is not marked as imported once it
has passed health checks at U.S. borders.
  (8)    (8)  reference    
  Furthermore, meat imported into the U.S. from Central
America is categorised, after it leaves its point of entry, as
domestic beef.   For wholesale and marketing purposes it is
just "beef".   So when McDonald 's spokesman state that the
company only uses 'indigenous' beef
  box  
they are speaking the truth as they see it, without
recognising that the beef could possibly originate from
outside the U.S.
  (9)    (9)  reference      
    There are, and always have been, a substantial amount
of reports refuting McDonald 's claims.  
    Dr Norman Myers, a senior Associate of the World
Wildlife Fund in the U.S. and Environmental consultant under
the U.S. National Academy of Science (amongst others), stated
that during his visits to Costa Rica in late 1976 and early
and mid-1979 he heard   "on more than one occasion,
during discussions with the Grupo Ganadero Industria de Costa
Rica (a rancher 's organisation), that Costa Rican beef does
indeed find its way into McDonald 's hamburgers.     In
addition, a production engineer of the Guatemalan beef packing
plant Industria de Ganaderos Guatemalicos, and a supplier to
McDonald 's, stated in late 1979 that he was purchasing beef
directly     form    from     the Guatemalan beef
packing plant in question  "  .
  (10)    (10)  reference      
    A great deal of further investigating was done and
McDonald 's eventually received a letter from the Duke of
Edinburgh acknowledging that Dr Myers and the World Wildlife
Fund were satisfied that McDonald 's were exonerated from any
implication in the destruction of Rainforests.  
    Jeremy Hill and Hilary Scannell in a Third World First
publication state:   "In Haiti companies own land in the
fertile valleys while the peasants have tiny subsistence farms
on barren mountain slopes.     Among the produce of the
valleys is alfalfa - to be feed to cattle owned by
McDonald 's    "    .
  (11)    (11)  reference      
    Over the years McDonald 's has become so defensive
about being associated with Rainforest destruction that they
have issued a Corporate Policy Statement.   It is a rather
bulky document that includes several retractions by well known
people including the ex-pop singer Sting and even TV3 's
  Nightline   presenter Belinda Todd.   Todd 's on-air
apology     occured    occurred     on April 24,
1990 after her previous     nights    night 's    
comments 'implied' that by not eating at McDonald 's, Brazilian
Rainforests would be saved.  
    One retraction that will never be included is by Otago
University 's Student Newspaper editor Emma Reid.   Emma
recently received a flurry of legalese from an Auckland lawyer
on behalf of McDonald 's.   According to the lawyer,
  Critic 's   editorial (April 3, 1990) had overstepped
that fine line that so many journalists walk when talking
about McDonald 's and environmental issues.  
    Emma 's retraction was done in fine style with a
cartoon cover titled "The Amazon Rain Forest".   Only one
tree remained in a valley of tree stumps.   The animals are
pitifully hanging off its branches whilst a clown - not too
dissimilar to Ronald - is gleefully hacking away at its base
with an axe.  
    The same Auckland lawyer put pen to paper and came up
with this gem:   "...we observe that the resemblance to
Ronald McDonald is by no means total, but we are accordingly
disposed to think that the retraction compiled with the
cartoon indicates something less than a wholehearted desire to
retract and apologise"  .   Luckily for
  Critic 's   finances the letter ended with a "warning".
  Strike one for the people!   Whatever the truth of the
various allegations about McDonald 's directly using rainforest
beef, two things are clear.   By its sheer popularisation
and promotion of the hamburger as a symbol of the global
supermarket and international consumerism, McDonald 's acts to
create a world market.   A market other companies will
inevitably tap by exploiting rainforest beef.  
    Secondly, that the West 's apparent insatiable desire
for cheap meat (whether for burgers, pet food or processed
meat
  cartoon  
products), exerts enormous market pressures on beef producers
to exploit the cheapest and most available land - often
tropical forest.
  (12)    (12)  reference      
  box  
    OZONE DAMAGE    
    Leaving the issue of beef aside, environmentalists
have also long been questioning McDonald 's use of paper and
plastics that go into its throw-away packaging.   In 1972 it
was estimated that it took 315 square miles of forest per year
to keep the company supplied in paper.
  (13)    (13)  reference      
    This figure does not take into account the damage
caused to the ozone layer by plastic foam packaging
manufactured using
    chloroflurocarbons    chlorofluorocarbons    
(CFCs).  
    In a desperate attempt to stem criticism McDonald 's
headquarters boldly announced, on August 5 1987, that because
there were   "reasonable alternatives to possibly
harmful CFCs"   it would begin   "a prompt phase
out"  .   The change took 16 months to complete in the
U.S.   World outlets would then follow the U.S. example.
  (14)    (14)  reference      
    This did not mean that McDonald 's and other companies
were banning plastic foams but merely looking for an
alternative.   The way they found to circumvent restrictions
on CFC usage was accomplished by changing the name of one CFC,
with the help of the U.S. Government.   McDonald 's could now
continue to use it without incurring the public 's wrath about
ozone depletion.   Instead of calling this chemical CFC-22
as the industry had for half   a   century it was renamed
"HCFC-22".
    (15)    (15)  reference      
    Despite this distinction CFC-22 and HCFC-22 are the
same chemical&semi; a green house gas and an ozone destroyer.
  But HCFC-22 is not listed in the Montreal Protocol roster
of ozone depleting chemicals to be controlled.
  (16)    (16)  reference    
  Environmentalists realise this and are working to gain its
inclusion as a  'recognised' ozone depleter.  
    However to Aotearoa 's credit we are the only country
in the McDonald 's 's  first ' originally single quote
mark   empire to use paperboard packaging for burger
cartons.   In all other countries McDonald 's uses foam
packaging.   However outside of Aotearoa McDonald 's jargon
about packaging changes has not slowed down the worldwide
protest trend that they seem to attract wherever their
tentacles spread.   On July 11, 1990   The Press  
reported an incident outside the company 's soon to be opened
Bondi Beach branch.   Environmentalists were protesting the
company 's "polystyrene packaging" and want them to
  "revert to recycled cardboard"  .   All of
which makes perfect ecological sense.
  (17)    (17)  reference      
    Two weeks later   The Press   carried an article
about an East German politician calling for a ban on
McDonald 's being allowed to cross the Berlin Wall.
  McDonald 's had planned to open 10 outlets in East Germany
by 1991.   But, Ernst Doerfler, chairman of East Germany 's
environmental committee, said banning takeaway restaurants
which use disposable plastic plates and cutlery was the only
way to avoid     capitalisms    capitalism 's    
worst environmental mistakes.
  (18)    (18)  reference      
    If Ernst Doerfler defeats the McDonald 's onslaught
then East Germany will join Morocco, who has also banned major
hamburger chains from setting up.   Indonesia, taking a
slightly different angle, has prohibited all fast food
companies from advertising on television.
  (19)    (19)  reference      
    Ironically, while fast food corporations are some of
the worst contributors to global litter and waste they are
also very keen to be seen as "green".   Corporate giants are
boosting the coffers of environmental groups in return for
influence and a greener image.   The Sierra Club, after
considerable agonising, recently turned down $700,000 from
McDonald 's, who wanted to sponsor an environmental education
project.   The Audubon society, another environmental fund,
were made a similar offer but also refused.
  (20)    (20)  reference    
  In the trade this is known as a "Green Wash".  
    However, to dismiss all McDonald 's protesters as
"greenies" is to do these people a grave misjustice.   For
many people McDonald 's is
    synonomous    synonymous     with 'Union
busting' and youth exploitation primarily.   Environmental
concerns and the issue of 'cultural imperialism', while very
important, are nevertheless a secondary issue.  
    CHEAP LABOUR    
    The backbone of McDonald 's has always been cheap
labour.   This was clearly shown by Kroc 's own actions in
1972 when he backed Richard Nixon 's Presidential campaign to
the tune of $200,000.   Soon after the election Nixon backed
a Bill calling for a   "below minimum wage"  
which would allow employers to hire 16 and 17 year old 's, as
well as full-time students, at 80% of the minimum wage.
  For companies like McDonald 's this 'proposal' would save
them millions.   While the Bill was thrown out by the
Senate, Nixon 's veto made sure it was passed into law.
  (21)    (21)  reference      
    The company 's practice of only hiring young part-time
workers is well known.   Christchurch Hotel Workers Union
organiser, Diane O'Keefe believes that   "the worst
people affected are school leavers who don't know their rights
and are basically too scared to stand up for them when
anything happens"  .  
  box  
    Today McDonald 's is the U.S. largest corporate
employer of youth with more than half of its 500,000 employees
under 20.   One out of every 15 Americans works at
McDonald 's as their first job.
  (22)    (22)  reference    
  In Britain 75% of the
    companys    company 's     workers are under
21.   In Australia workers have complained about being
sacked when they turned 20.   This practice allows the
company to avoid paying adult wages to employees.  
      In Australia and Britain part-time workers often
work long hours without the company having to pay out
sickness,holiday or other benefits.
  (23)    (23)  reference    
  McDonald 's high turnover of workers clearly reflects their
working conditions.  
    Combined with the company 's policy of employing young
part-time workers is a strong anti-union stance.   Hotel
Workers Union official Ken Howell says McDonald 's has a
worldwide policy of trying to keep Unions off its premises.
  (24)    (24)  reference    
  Only workers in Aotearoa and the USSR are protected by
compulsory unions.   However McDonald 's philosophy in these
countries remains the same.  
    The most outrageous action take by McDonald 's
management as part of 'union busting' occurred in San
Francisco where employees were forced to submit to lie
detector tests - if they refused they were dismissed.
  Those who took them were asked if they had any Union
sympathies, and whether they had ever stolen or given away any
hamburgers.   This practice was eventually stopped by law
after public outcry.
  (25)    (25)  reference      
  box  
    Last year NZ award talks were stalled as McDonald 's
refused to let Union organisers into staffrooms and kitchens.
  Instead, employees had to be interviewed in the public
restaurant.   McDonald 's also would not deduct union fees
unless Union officials personally interviewed each
    McDonald    McDonald 's     employee first.
  Hotel Workers organiser Joan Godfrey believed that the
biggest block to progress had been McDonald 's:   "They
are American owned and well skilled in anti-union
methods"  .   She concluded that while
  "McDonald 's spend megabucks on their adverts and like
to be known as benevolent in the community ... they 're making
heaps of profits and they are happy to exploit women
workers"  .
  (26)    (26)  reference      
    Managing Director of McDonald 's New Zealand, Mr Gary
Lloydd, believed that Union officials were standing in the way
of job opportunities during negotiations.   Mr Lloydd was
trying to reduce the minimum hours for shift work from 4 to 2
hours which in turn   "would create 700 extra shifts a
week"   at McDonald 's alone.   This would allow
McDonald 's and its staff increased flexibility.
  (27)    (27)  reference      
    For many, McDonald 's is a perfect example of every
aspect about Adam Smith 's diatribe that is loathsome.   We
are repulsed by the mesmerised stranglehold that McDonald 's
has over the American psyche.   According to corporate
claims two out of every 3 U.S. adults
    eats    eat     at McDonald 's at least once a
month while 96% of U.S. school-children ranked Ronald McDonald
- that colourful, fun loving cretinous clown - second only to
Santa Claus.
  (28)    (28)  reference    
  What the ads do not tell you is that fast food is as low
on nutrition as it is high on unhealthy fats and
additives.  
    Ironically McDonald 's combines its hardnosed sense of
business with a contradictory stance in that the corporation
is obsessed by public relations and this is where the dream 's
bubble is being burst.   Just as a young child seeks
constant approval and attention, so does McDonald 's seek to be
seen as doing the right thing.   This is clearly reflected
in the millions of dollars that they deliberately spend in the
local community - be it promoting seatbelt safety or cot death
research.   We might term this 'conscience money'.  
    The question is whether their concern with public
opinion inspires real changes in their operations or merely
more elaborate public relations.   For example, at present
McDonald 's is organising a trial recycling project due to be
tested in Auckland stores later this year.   By September
many items of packaging material as well as office stationery
will be printed on 100% recycled paper.   Combine these
gains with the fact that employees, who used to aim to serve
up orders in a minute, will soon     by    be    
joining their American counter-parts in racing the clock to
beat 30 seconds.  
    While this obsession with speed may be a necessity in
the U.S. it is certainly not a part of our lives or 'culture'.
  McDonald 's has a basic lack of understanding about the
countries they operate in, outside of the U.S. that is.
  McDonald 's boast that their product is the same throughout
the world, but this clearly fails to take into account
different cultures, needs or tastes.   In South America
beans were asked to be included, in Australia it was beetroot
and tomato.   In both cases national preferences were
arrogantly ignored.   Instead our taste buds have been
bombarded with bland chemically laden food.   Yet another
example of homogenised American culture being thrust down our
throats.   It 's like my friend Donald said to me:
  "Stick a fork in their ass and turn them over, they 're
done"  .      
  

        HANG   'EM   HIGH?    
  illustration  
    New Zealanders no longer hang those who kill
others.   But in the 1950s capital punishment was still on
the law books and eight men were executed.   Some of their
deaths were appallingly bungled and the lives of those who
hanged them were forever tainted by the experience.   Should
the death sentence ever again be legal in our
country?  
    by Greg Newbold  
      O  N THE FIRST day of July 1987, 2000
placard-carrying men, women and children marched to Aotea
Square in Auckland.   Similar rallies took place in
Whangarei, Hamilton, Taumaranui and Napier.   The
occasion of the gatherings was the funeral of six-year-old
Teresa Cormack, whose defiled and decomposing body had been
found a week before amid the seaweed and driftwood on
Whirinaki Beach.   Her death was not a cause so much as a
catalyst of the July demonstrations, for in the winter of
1987 sentiment about violent and sexual offending was already
high.  
    In March the previous year a Christchurch woman
had been abducted, raped and strangled, before being left for
dead in the boot of a car.   Seven months later, in the same
city, six-year-old Louisa Damodran had been abducted after
school and drowned.   The offenders in both cases had
histories of sexual crime.   In January 1987 a woman had
been subjected to a prolonged rape at a Mongrel Mob
convention in Auckland.   The report of the Committee of
Inquiry into Violence, released in March, had shown that
annual murder and manslaughter convictions had increased
almost fourfold since the late 1960s.   Rape and attempted
rape had grown nearly fivefold.   Serious assaults had leapt
sevenfold.   In December a   New Zealand Herald  -NRB
poll showed that concern over law and order was mounting
faster than any other problem in New Zealand.  
    The gathering of the crowds in North Island centres in
July 1987 reflected the mood of the nation.   Violent crime
was out of control.   It was time to get tough with
offenders.     "Hang   'em   high"  ,
  "Show no mercy"  ,   "Bring back capital
punishment"   the placards blared.   In Auckland
the mob chanted and cheered as workmen on a nearby
building site hanged a human effigy.   Below, in front of
television cameras, an hysterical woman screamed,
  "Hang them! Hang them!"   into attentive
microphones.  
    To those with longer memories, the Aotea Square scenes
were nothing new.   They had been rehearsed often before,
not only in New Zealand but also in Britain and the US.
  Britain suspended executions in 1965 and abolished them in
1969.   IRA bombings have led to vocal but vain calls for
reintroduction.   In the US, which had begun a decade-long
moratorium on executions in 1967, clamour for resumption
continued until January 1977, when Gary Gilmore faced a
firing squad in Utah.   Since then more than 100 killers
have been shot, gassed, hanged, electrocuted or dispatched by
lethal injection&semi; 2200 more await their fate on death row.
  Murder statistics continue to soar, with over 20,000
criminal homicides recorded in the US every year.   But in
the Land of the Free, support for capital punishment is
unabated.  
      L  IKE the US, New Zealand is one of
the few nations in the world to have withdrawn, then recalled,
capital punishment.   Initially installed here in 1840
according to British colonial law, execution for murder
was suspended in 1935, repealed in 1941, brought back in 1950,
suspended again in 1957 and finally, in 1961, done away with
for good.    
    During the 102 years that this country practised
hanging, 43 men and one woman were executed.   Support for
the scaffold has waxed and waned but, as the events of July
1987 indicated, it has never gone completely.   Although
wide support (and political following) can be gained by
apologists for capital punishment, few people today
remember very much about it.   The issue is far more
complicated than simply whether or not killers should swing.
  A close look at the lesson of the 1950s, when hanging was
returned experimentally for seven years, reveals aspects of
the practice which give considerable food for thought.  
    The suspension of capital punishment in 1935 was not
popular.   It had occurred as part of the
liberal/humanitarian philosophies of the incoming Labour
Government, and it was to be six years before the penalty
was actually legislated away.   This change attracted little
notice at the time but, as World War II drew to a close and
attention moved away from the battle zones, dissatisfaction
grew.   To begin with, reported murders increased
dramatically, from five in 1942 to 10 in 1943.   In 1944
there were 20, and another 20 in 1945.   Such sharp
jumps were unprecedented in 20th-century New Zealand and,
coming on the heels of abolition, seemed clear evidence that
the soft approach was failing.   From 1941 every brutal
murder was blamed by death-penalty lobbyists on the absence of
the gallows.  
    The first major outcry came in August 1942 with the
slaying of two elderly sisters and was redoubled in 1946, 1947
and 1948, after a series of four grisly murders which remain
unsolved to this day.   Following the war reported murders
gained even richer press coverage, added to in August 1948
when a young sex offender on parole sexually maimed and
murdered a middle-aged woman out for a Sunday walk.   No
sooner had this sensation faded away than a man hacked his
child and two women to death in a psychopathic frenzy.   At
the trial he displayed no remorse, and his words before the
incident,   "Even if you do murder these days you only
get eight years&semi; that 's because of the good government we 've
got,"   drew wide notice.   Convicting him in April
1949, the jury added a rider calling for the restoration of
the death penalty.  
    The murders and murder trials of 1948 and 1949 ensured
that the issue of hanging had no chance to cool in the vital
months preceding the election of November 1949.   The
National Party pledged that, if elected, it would bring back
the death penalty.   After a decisive victory, it wasted no
time fulfilling its promise&semi; within 12 months capital
punishment was back on the books.  
    In February 1951, only 11 weeks after hanging had been
reinstated, Gordon McSherry was condemned for killing a bank
clerk during a robbery.   He was speedily reprieved, but the
outcry which followed was a warning that vacillation would not
be tolerated.   There had been eight convictions for murder
in 1950, at the time the highest annual figure on record.
  If that trend continued, the sentence would soon be
confirmed.  
    Between 1951 and 1957 the sentence of death was passed
22 times for murder in New Zealand, and was carried out eight
times.   All the hangings took place at Mt Eden prison.  
    After McSherry 's reprieve the next person convicted of
murder was William Fiori, condemned for slaying his
employer and his employer 's wife, for money.   Described
officially as   "border  -  line
feeble-minded"  , Fiori had lodged no appeal against
conviction, although a recommendation for clemency had been
made by the trial jury.   Having received the prisoner
following his sentencing, the Mt Eden authorities anxiously
awaited the verdict of the Executive Council.  
    From the time of the conviction Horace Haywood, the
prison superintendent, maintained close contact with
Fiori.   The trial had been conducted in Hamilton and
Haywood himself was a member of the escort which had
transferred the prisoner to Auckland.   Fiori had been
condemned on February 14 and it was almost three weeks before
Cabinet decided that there were no grounds for clemency.
  Haywood relayed the news to   caption    photo  
the capital cell.   Seven days later, on the evening of
Thursday, March 13, 1952, the hanging party, led by Haywood,
escorted its trembling victim to the prison basement.   The
hood was fitted and the noose secured.   The signal was
given, the trap sprung, and a split second later Fiori 's body
swung twitching at the end of the rope.  
    After Fiori, the second man to drop was Eruera Te
Rongopatahi who, after a dispute with his girlfriend, had gone
out and shot a taxi-driver.   Te Rongopatahi died in
September 1953 and a little over three months later, two weeks
before Christmas, Harry "Darkie" Whiteland, an Indian railway
worker, was executed for shooting a fellow employee after an
argument.   For 18 months no more hangings took place,
but in the five months between July and December 1955 there
were four.  
    On July 7 English immigrant Frederick Foster was
executed for shooting a former lover, and Edward Te Whiu was
hung on August 13.   Te Whiu, a simple boy of 20, had
strangled an old woman during a robbery.   On October 13,
Eric Allwood died for shooting his drinking partner and on
December 5 Albert Black was executed.   An Irish migrant,
Black had stabbed another man after quarrelling over a
woman.   Like Whiteland, two years before, he wished
observers a Merry Christmas.  
    The eighth and last execution was James Bolton, who
died 15 months after Black.   Bolton 's case was unusual&semi; he
differed markedly from the young nondescripts who had gone
before him.   Bolton was 68 years old, a successful farm
manager, convicted of poisoning his wife.   He vigorously
protested his innocence to the end and there is still
doubt about his guilt (see   Listener  , April 22,
1989).   On February 18, 1957, the day he was scheduled to
die (though he was unaware of it at the time), Bolton
requested an interview with the superintendent and
made an impassioned plea for his life.   But the hour of
execution had been set and, in order to avoid
embarrassment, Bolton was brought to the gallows so
heavily sedated (yet still distraught) that he virtually
had to be dragged by prison staff.  
  illustration  
      I  N SPITE OF their supposed deterrent
function, judicial executions in this country were veiled
in secrecy and the Government took care to allow as little
publicity about them as possible.   But inevitably they were
public events.   Apart from official personnel, a limited
number of spectators was allowed.   Any justice of the peace
was permitted to attend, as were representatives of the
police.   News delegates, too, were invited along, provided
they exercised "restraint" in their published accounts.
  Condemned men were allowed to receive religious
instruction from a minister of their choice, and to request
that he attend their hanging.  
    The effects of executions on witnesses were various.
  In his book   While We Have Prisons  , former prison
psychologist Don MacKenzie remembers a justice of the peace
who made a point of attending every hanging.   He was, he
said, studying their   "psychological effects"  .
  Most spectators were less intrigued.   A
  Truth   newspaper representative who attended Black 's
execution was clearly repelled by what he saw, as were members
of the clergy.   Some churchmen had to be pressured by
their seniors into doing their share of an onerous duty.
  Father A H Hyde, parish priest of St Benedict 's Catholic
Church, attended two executions - those of Te Rongopatahi
and Black - and he described the first as the most unnerving
experience of his life.   The morning after, he said, he was
so drained that he could not stand up straight when he got out
of bed.   It took him a week or two to get over the
emotional impact.   Knowing the strain they could have,
therefore, Hyde insisted that padres should never attend
hangings alone.  
    Among the worst affected were the sheriffs.   They
were the official directors of proceedings, whose job it was
formally to command the superintendent to
  "surrender the body of the prisoner"   and
then signal the hangman to pull the trap lever.   MacKenzie
reports that during the 1951-57 period, three different
sheriffs officiated, and each was seriously affected.
  One suffered a physical collapse at an execution and had
to be held up by two prison officers while he performed his
sombre duty.   Another so dreaded executions that he
began turning up to them drunk.   Each of these men went
sick - for periods of up to four months - after an execution,
suffering symptoms such as shock, anxiety, nervous exhaustion
and duodenal haemorrhaging.  
    Officers I have spoken to feel that opinion among
prison staff on capital punishment was divided about 50-50,
but tended more towards abolition as the
  box    caption    photo   number of executions
mounted.   Personnel chosen for hanging duty were
replaced if they showed any signs of nervousness and only
the most stoic and reliable were considered.   The job was
not for the faint of heart.   When Frederick Foster refused
to raise his chin for the noose, MacKenzie reports, one of the
party later boasted of having stuck his fingers into the
terrified man 's eyes to force his head back.   Some openly
defended the penalty.   Others remained non-committal.
  Many of the older officers had seen active service during
the war and their experiences had inured them to suffering.
    "There was nothing personal in it,"   one
said to me.       "We were only carrying out the
sentence of the court."      
    But the officers in the hanging party were protected
to some degree from emotional involvement because they had no
contact with a prisoner before his time.   The men on "death
watch", who monitored the prisoner 24 hours a day, were in a
different situation.   For them empathy with the condemned
was inevitable.   It was their good fortune never to be
required to join the hanging party because, by the time the
execution took place, they had grown to know the victim well.
  They tended to oppose the penalty more strongly.  
  illustration  
      T  HE PERSON most affected was the
prison superintendent, Horace Haywood.   His contact
with the condemned was both intimate and unavoidable.   To
him fell the task of seeing to the health and welfare of
capital cases and of ensuring, if the sentence was confirmed,
that it was carried out smoothly.  
    His job was the most stressful of all, since the whole
burden of the ritual fell on him.   The superintendent was
in close contact with a capital man and his family from the
time he was sentenced to the time his corpse was taken from
the institution, the day after his death.   For him there
was no escape from the pain, the anguish and the suffering of
a condemned man and his family.   When a reprieve was
granted, Haywood quickly relayed the news to the death cell.
  When one was denied, it was his job to inform the prisoner
that he would face the gallows within seven days.   On the
evening of an execution he had to have the prisoner
prepared for death.   The transfer of the condemned to
the basement, the pinioning of his limbs, the fitting of the
hood, the positioning of the noose, tightly, around the
victim 's neck - all these crucial tasks were the
superintendent 's ultimate concern.   If anything went
wrong, he would have to answer for it, and it was his
conscience that would be plagued.  
    Such a solemn duty, such an horrific responsibility,
weighed cruelly on Haywood 's mind.   On 22 occasions, he
had to receive and care for people condemned to death by the
courts, without knowing whether or not the sentence would be
carried out.   On eight occasions over a seven-year period,
Haywood was forced to accompany men on their final walk.  
    The effect of all this on the superintendent was
marked.   Every execution took its toll, some more than
others, but with each hanging the accumulated
  photos    captions   impact grew.   Haywood
started to drink, and as time went by his ability to cope got
worse.   He began taking alcohol before executions, and also
tended increasingly to blot out his feelings afterwards.
  Haywood 's boozing was noticed by both staff and
inmates and became a topic of comment around the jail.
  After officiating at an execution in Fiji, Haywood was off
work for some weeks.   It was rumoured that he was lying in
bed blind drunk, throwing empty whisky bottles at the wall.
  One inmate is said to have personally accused Haywood
of drowning his emotions in grog whenever a hanging was due.
  Another was put on charge for saying to an officer,
  "Yeah, Haywood would still be sucking on his whisky
bottle after telling the bloke to pull the lever."    
      Haywood 's rapid deterioration soon showed in other
aspects of his life.   He became increasingly paranoid,
festooning his home with locks.   He began carrying a loaded
pistol around with him.   He grew grey and tired looking,
and started falling asleep at work.   Towards the end of the
1950s it was clear that a man whose ability and initiative had
driven him rapidly through the junior ranks in the late 1940s
was having difficulty coping with his job.   Finally, in
1963, he was removed from his post.   Ten months later, he
died, a shattered man.   It would be wrong to blame the
executions totally for Haywood 's downfall, but they were a
significant part of it.  
    In 1957 National was ousted and the new Labour
Government suspended executions again.   A single voting
majority in the House made Labour hesitant to legislate,
and it was not until after 1960, when National got back into
power, that anything was done.   In 1961 Ralph Hanan, the
new Minister of Justice, and the only National member to have
voted against capital punishment in 1950, introduced a law
which again removed capital punishment for murder.  
  illustration  
      F  EW ISSUES in modern penology have
been discussed so hotly, so often and at such length as
capital punishment.   The major problem is that, as with
religion, people 's convictions about the subject are more
often emotional than logical and not, therefore, always
responsive to argument.   Where New Zealand is concerned,
the experience of the 50s provides some useful
perspectives on the enigmatic question of judicial
killings.  
    As in the US, homicide rates in New Zealand have shown
no relation to the presence or absence of the death penalty
and there is serious doubt among criminologists that the
majority of murders can be affected by it.   Mortal threat
is no great deterrent to many forms of human behaviour.
  Racing drivers, mountain climbers, drug addicts and
cigarette smokers all pursue their fancies despite the risks
involved.   In wartime people volunteer to fight en masse,
knowing that the chances of being killed are considerable.
  The true impetus behind arguments to retain the death
penalty is not a reduction of the murder rate but a burning
desire for vengeance.   The mood at the end of the 40s and
the events at Aotea Square in 1987 are both clear examples of
this.  
    One of the most powerful arguments against capital
punishment concerns the possibility of error.   The
guilt of Bolton is still questioned today.   The altered
verdict in the Australian Chamberlain case, the Guildford Four
in Britain, our own Arthur Thomas and later Dean Wickliffe,
are further chilling reminders of the fallibility of British
justice.   The judges and juries who determine another
human 's fate are not omniscient authorities but merely
flesh and blood.  
    But, even when they are conducted according to the
best principles of sovereign law, executions degrade not
only the legal system but the people associated with it.
  In the 1950s, padres were devastated, sheriffs crumbled.
  The hangmen were often nervous and unsure of what they
were supposed to be doing.   On one occasion the noose was
wrongly fitted.   On another the lever was almost pulled too
early.   Sometimes the victim 's neck didn't break.
  (Presumably this was fairly common in the 19th century,
until the position of the knot was changed in 1891.)   In
1934 it is recorded that William Bayly died from asphyxiation&semi;
his pulse was still strong four minutes after the drop, so a
prison officer had to be dispatched to the pit to swing on his
legs.   There were problems with Bolton in 1958.   Unable
to support himself on his feet, it is rumoured that he fell
tied to a chair.   He, too, died of strangulation.  
    The lesson of the 1950s is that capital punishment in
New Zealand was a sorry failure.   If it was ever
reintroduced, the problems which plagued it before would
undoubtedly return.   Hanging murderers did not alter the
rate of homicide.   The practice was not always carried out
humanely&semi; at times it was a bungled disgrace.   It did not
even satisfy the public for long, and so it failed in its
symbolic purpose.   What the gallows did achieve was the
deaths of eight working men trapped by vicious circumstance.
  Their misfortune disturbed only a few and their pain
expiated many sins.   But nothing the scaffold did could
ever compensate for the tainted lives of those who worked
beneath its shadow.      
  

      speculations    
      an end to barbarism?    
      Could the
    90s      '90s       be the decade in which
we rediscover the worth of civilised behaviour and find we now
have the courage and convictions to defend it?   Surely the
barbarians have had it too good for too long.    
    WHILE THE     90s      '90s      
don't actually begin until next year, it seems churlish to
wait until then to pontificate on what to expect during the
"next decade" when 1990 happens to be our own year of
assessment, celebration and introspection.   Also, I must
admit to a perception that there is something new in the
air.  
    When I first began to make plans to attend Kiri 's
Homecoming, I looked forward to an opportunity to combine a
summer 's evening picnic with some fine music in the company of
good friends.   I found myself in the middle of an Auckland
Woodstock&semi; a Woodstock in that it was a huge gathering,
drawn by a musical event, and which transcended itself to
embody a unifying mood which I suspect will dominate
New Zealand during the next decade.  
    Furthermore, the majority of Kiri 's audience was of
the Woodstock generation, "doing its thing" again.   Older,
more affluent, and maybe less flamboyant, but still able to
demonstrate that the baby-boom generation continues to
call the lifestyle shots as it bulges its way through the
demographic marketplace.  
    I was living in America during the original Woodstock
festival, studying Planning and Public Policy at the
University of California in Berkeley.   In those
counter-culture times, one of the notions under attack was the
culture of the ruling elite.   Elitist tastes were to be
enjoyed only in the privacy of one 's home - and to be quickly
abandoned if neighbours called.   We wore jeans and beads,
sat cross-legged or lounged on bean bags and didn't trust
anyone over 30.  
    Rock and folk music was in.   Street theatre and
street music was in.   Opera, chamber music and
"legitimate" theatre was out.   Film actors learned to
mumble - good diction was elitist.   Executives hung their
children 's daubs as paintings in their office.   Student
radicals demanded "relevant education" - stimulated by our own
Ashton-  Warner 's   Teacher  .   There was even
a movement to teach ghetto-jive in black schools as a
legitimate dialect because it was unfair to require black
children to learn middle class (hence elitist) English.
  (Black leaders were smart enough to reject this liberal
fantasy - they may well have read
  Pygmalion  .)  
    Anti-elitism was a coherent movement and naturally
spread to New Zealand.  
    The cause had its merits.   Catch phrases such as
"Power to the People" promoted the democratic ideal and
truly encouraged those in power to give credence to community
views which did not necessarily coincide with their own.
  This side of the cause led to such reforms as the
introduction of ward systems into New Zealand local body
elections and one cannot argue against that.   At least I
can't, because I was part of it.  
    But in promoting the worthiness of the different
cultures of "the people", the movement began to foster the
rejection of high-quality art in favour of the elevation of
naive craft or even downright rubbish.   While this trend
was driven by a legitimate desire to give greater credence to
the heritage and customs of minorities, ethnic groups and the
poor, it was accompanied by the surely misguided view that
such elevation necessitated a down  -  grading of the
dominant culture of the West.  
    Any economist could have assured us that artistic
works and other expressions of a culture are not bound by
what they call "the zero-sum rule".   To recognise and
appreciate greater worth in Maori or Aboriginal art, there is
no need to devalue any other.   The total value of our
humanity is simply increased - as Te Maori surely proved.  
    But if this argument is clearly wrong, why did it take
such hold and why did those of us born to elitist ideals cave
in and accept our guilt?  
    AGAIN THE ECONOMISTS had part of the explanation.
  It was easy to demonstrate that the elite had been
hijacking taxes to support its artistic and cultural tastes.
  Governments subsidised chamber music seats while
teenagers paid full price at rock concerts.   The public
library system collected money from the poor to provide
cheap reading for the middle class.   Even today the poor
pay for their videos while the affluent borrow "free" books.
  Higher "professional" education represents the single
greatest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich - as
we are reluctantly conceding.  
    Such subsidies of the cultural values of the ruling
class were justified by the altruistic notion that it opened
up these valuable pursuits to the poor who otherwise could not
afford to enjoy them.   The fact that the poor stayed away
in droves was just unfortunate and showed that maybe more
subsidies were needed.  
    When the Aotea Centre was first mooted in Auckland,
there was a huge outcry from those who argued that such
temples to the elite were no longer needed.   The idea of
great art had died - presumably along with God.
  Alternative schemes proposed open-air theatres for
buskers, clowns and mime troupes and arenas for demonstrations
of pottery, weaving, macram&eacute; and carving.
  Thankfully we simply widened the footpaths and changed the
bylaws.   Queen Street is the richer for it.    
        Groovy Grannies    
      We have been called recycled teenagers,
perverted pensioners and groovy grannies.   Looked at from
the stultifying, societal stereotype - the knitting,
babysitting, beshawled and be-slippered "granny" - I
suppose that we are.      
    We are the young women of the war years and
frontrunners of the women 's liberation movement, now not so
much demanding liberation for the over-60s as demonstrating
and exploring it.   We are also the generation of universal
superannuitants with a reasonably adequate income, for some
their first financial independence.  
    Are we, then, the trailblazers for future vigorous,
independent, positive and respected older women?  
    Suddenly ageing has become exciting.   We can choose
what to do with our lives and some of us are choosing
adventure.  
    Last year six Kapiti women, aged 61 to 71, paddled
Canadian canoes 80 kilometres down the Wanganui River.   One
of them went on to ski in Switzerland, two to an Outdoor
Pursuits Centre course in Turangi, two to sea-kayak in the
Sounds, one to walk the Heaphy Track, four to a rock-climbing
and abseiling course.  
    These are not isolated achievements.   All over the
country older women are participating not only in sports
considered "suitable" for their age group but in others
not available to them when they were younger.   Tramping,
swimming, aquarobics, mountaineering, horse riding,
gliding, wherever there is an activity there is a grey-haired
woman taking part.  
    Nor are they adventuring   only   into physical
exploits.   A significant number did not progress much
beyond primary school, some had opportunities for tertiary
education curtailed by the war and later were unable to attend
courses or night classes because of caring for families.  
    Many are hungry for further education&semi; even more are
seeking information.  
    In "Learning Later" (1989) David Battersby asserts
  "a healthy aged brain is as active as a healthy young
brain"  .   While only a few will attempt university
courses many are being attracted to lectures held at
suitable times for older people, stimulated to further reading
and even study.  
    We are discovering latent talents in the arts and new
crafts, stimulating our minds learning bridge, mahjong, chess,
scrabble, computer skills, home and car maintenance.  
    Physical and mental health are a priority.   Not
just hedonistic occupations but deliberate attempts to
maintain supple minds and bodies and learn skills to enrich
the probably less active years ahead.  
  box  
    On the whole these women would not wish to return to
the labour force.   Even had they been in gainful employment
most spent much of their lives in unpaid work and still do as
well as opting for voluntary jobs.   The thousands of hours
they give to this are largely unrecognised, yet are a major
contribution to total wealth.   Among them are also the
adventuring women.  
    Perhaps if this work were to receive financial
recognition the nature of the choice to do it and the caring
itself would change.   There are rewards in the need to be
needed and the opportunity for social intercourse.
  However, better funding of the organisations
themselves could relieve these unpaid workers of the extra
chore of fund raising.  
    As older women are uniting some are showing interest
in community and national issues.   While their efforts are
largely unco-ordinated at present and often only on older age
matters, the way is being opened for a positive use of the
better education, wider experience and larger numbers of
the next generation of retirees.  
    This has been a middle class view - there are still
the elderly poor who are also lonely, ill, ill-educated, whose
lives remain empty just because of increased and enforced
leisure.   We have been looking at that new age of older
people who say, "I don't know how I found the time to go to
work".   Because they are showing the possibilities that
leisure offers, expectations of ageing will change, ageism
will disappear.  
    We are demonstrating that leisure can be just as, if
not more, fulfilling than paid employment - it is largely a
matter of income maintenance.   Leisure is not just time for
filling, it is a   "convenient opportunity"  
(Chambers Dictionary 1974) to live well until we die.  
    In illustrating a whole range of leisure-time options
we are opening up a wider consumer market.   Producers are
lagging here and need to look at the market - for example,
what highly unsuitable swimming costumes we are being offered!
The need for well-placed, convenient facilities must be
filled.   Places that will centralise recreation, learning
and shopping (also a recreation), and more specialised local
transport.   Very many more older women than men do not own
a car.   There must be real recognition of our
contribution through voluntary work, as consumers and viable
contributors.   Because of our insistence on health we
are likely to live longer and more successfully so our skills
must be used when we wish to offer them.   The baby boomers
will come to retirement perhaps more prepared than we were but
it is we, the present retirees, who are breaking new ground
for them.  
    The Wanganui canoeists were accompanied by six
young women in kayaks as camera crew and support team.
  Perhaps our greatest contribution is in the words of one
of them:   "To all you wonderful 60s Up women with whom
I have so enjoyed adventuring, thank you for ... giving me the
inspiration to see my future in the outdoors as
limitless"  .  
      Slashing the censor    
      A   SENSE of foreboding accompanies the
enactment of the Films and Video Recordings Amendment
Bill, a law that effectively dumps chief film censor Arthur
Everard as from December 31.  
    It has as much to do with the undemocratic political
processes that allowed it to happen, as with the nature of
the campaign that resulted in his ousting on charges
that he had become   "desensitised"   and
  "too permissive"  .  
    The action is another frightened, knee-jerk
reaction that connects with those emotional and negative
forces in New Zealand society that would have us become a
first-class country for third-rate people.  
    These forces, which adopt the missionary position of
moral rectitude, which have more affinity with the
blood-letting, fundamentalist leanings of the Old Testament,
regrettably go some way to explain the anger and pain among
many of the young and the old on the streets.  
    Unfortunately there seem to be few people in NZ who
have enlightened attitudes of a kind that can deal with
explicit sexual expression on film and videotape and who
can talk about it objectively.   This helps explain why sex
education remains such a volatile issue, and why such
education is not yet in the forefront of policies of those
progressive forces who would guide it.  
    Everyone should take responsibility for improving
this situation.   A few have taken a lead.   The chief
film censor is among them.  
    I want first to deal with the matter of undemocratic
political processes.   The legislation limiting the term
of the chief film censor to six years (Everard has served
for 5 years, 6 months) was passed under urgency.   It was
rushed through second reading, committee and third reading
stages at a weekend sitting of Parliament.   Weekend
sittings are exceptionally rare events and tend to escape
full media attention.  
      The new law was conceived as a means of
streamlining the administrative requirements for film and
video.   The maximum term for the job of chief film
censor arose from an
  cartoon  
amendment in the committee stages of the bill, a committee
which appeared to be loaded in favour of pressure groups and
the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards.  
    The decision to put a maximum time limit on the
job seems to have been aimed at removing Everard.
  Until the law change, the term of chief film censor was
open-ended.   As a demonstrably apolitical position, it
was not determined by legislation.   Everard 's
predecessor, Bernie Tunnecliff, worked for more than 20
years as a film censor, first as assistant and then as chief.
  Indeed, there have been only seven chief film censors
since the office was
  quote  
established in 1916.  
    Despite the precedent-setting nature of the films and
video bill, it was passed unopposed.  
    Given the responsibility assumed by National Party
Opposition MP Katherine O'Regan for getting the measure
hoisted up the order paper and into the government 's urgency
motion, the whole exercise suggests a combined operation by
the Labour-National axis.  
    Party managers whose joint, and not-so-hidden, agenda
appears to be to keep Parliament safe for the two major
parties, might well have concluded that with an election
in four   months'   time this was the way to go.
  Impulse-buying, not the appeal to intelligence, is
perceived to be the way to deal with the electorate, given the
sticky climate created by the joyless-sex movement.   Best
for both parties to join together on this issue to limit any
debate that could be provoked by a third party or independent
candidates out on the hustings.  
    To see or not to see scenes of sex being enjoyed
between consenting adults, that was the question.   How
fortunate to have an electoral system that enshrines the two
party system and disallows any effective parliamentary debate
and progress on an issue that is as fundamental as
bread.  
    The great pity is that so little of chief film censor
Everard 's commonsense appears to have got through to thinking
citizens.   His voice has tended to be buried in the tirades
of those blinkered groups with their misguided messianic
ambitions to a better society through guilt and
repression.  
    These are just a few of the important things the film
censor has had to say over the years:
&bullet;   Research shows the concern is where
sexual violence is condoned and where a film endorses sexual
violence.
&bullet;   Audiences for sexually explicit
films are by no means the stereotyped "raincoat brigade".
  A high percentage of women are among those hiring sex
tapes.   At public screenings, audiences are a cross-section
of the population in age, sex and material circumstances.
  Some theatres have special rates for pensioners.
&bullet;   Young people are more
sophisticated and visually discerning than elders.
&bullet;   We (film censors) do become
"desensitised" to some degree, because we have to be
objective.  
    It is salutary, given the recent running-for-cover
performance in Parliament, to discover that all is by
no means lost.   At the other end of town stands another
kind of House of Representatives, the Embassy of Courtenay
Place, where, in July, large and enthusiastic crowds
attended the 19th Wellington Film Festival.  
    Once again audiences were treated to films from all
over the world that are entertaining and mature in their
depiction of love and its many forms of sexual expression.  
    One of them, an Italian film called Cinema Paradiso
could not have landed at a more opportune time.   It is a
marvellous and joyous celebration of life when movie-going
was the focus for the community.  
    The local priest is the village censor, who insists
kissing scenes and any suggestion of passionate touching be
excised.   The movies are of a period when   lovers'  
lips met astonishingly chastely and stars remained fully
clothed.  
    Father Adelfio is a great comic and human creation.
  The dilemma his face reflects when making his decisions
tells us more about his anxieties than the passion he has for
protecting his flock.   He lacks the kind of objectivity
that comes from life experience and joy in living.  
    Given Everard 's record this finding cannot be applied
to the outgoing film censor.  
    Whether it can be applied to strident pressure groups
which continue to foment fear and guilt about sex, and prefer
not to see how better they might approach love and sex in
their own lives, is quite another matter.

      TELEVISION   advertisements are a pain
in the retina when they interrupt your favourite programme,
but the secret to enjoying ads, like everything else in life,
lies in attitude.  
    Watch them critically and they 'll tell you much about
the state of contemporary culture.   Analysing ads may be
more fun in bigger countries whose companies have massive
advertising budgets, but over the years   our   ads have
been collecting a fair share of international creative
awards.   What are they showing us about ourselves?
  Social demarcation for one thing.  
    By the late   '80s  , members of that mythical
social class, yuppiedom, were popping up on ads for
everything from fashion and finance to service industries like
electricity.  
    The BNZ opted for grainy, slice-of-ordinary-life
vignettes (using taxi drivers, school teachers, new parents) to
express its contrition over past mistakes and its integrity.
  But other companies like Electricorp, Telecom and the Gas
Association flexed their corporate muscles in ads that went
overboard on pace and glamour.   It seemed that the more
prosaic the product, the more stylish the ad.  
    Take that terribly glamorous ad for the Gas
Association, which could as easily have been promoting the
contemporary designer lifestyle.   A soap-opera scenario
unfolds with a gorgeous young couple bickering in the back of a
taxi.   Cut to their stylish apartment where she "cools off"
in the shower while he whisks up a treat in the wok.   Gas is
modern and sophisticated, not fuddy duddy.   Gas is
cool.  
    Then there was Postbank and its yuppie couple
angsting over mortage lending rates, she sexy in a white
cotton bathrobe and wet hair, he brooding and intelligent in
fashionable horn-rimmed glasses.  
    But Telecom went all out for the yuppie vote of
confidence.   Its pre-crash ad looked like a promotion for
fast cars and flash clothes.   A cocksure young gun with a
phone in his briefcase devastated the boardroom with his
effrontery before leaping into his convertible and racing off
to his girlfriend.  
    Two years after the sharemarket crash, Telecom ads
showing all those sparkling, beautifully dressed men and women
doing glorious phone business look slightly unconvincing, but
Telecom is covering both ends of the market.   Upbeat,
  photos    caption  
upmarket ads for the business sector, downmarket
and downright sentimental for homemakers (  "Are you
lonesome tonight?"   warbles Elvis as the truckie places
a toll call to his wife).  
    Elevating the "perceived value" of a workaday product
with fashion-conscious ads set to a classic hits soundtrack
was   the   advertising trend of the late   '80s  .
  It 's come along hand in hand with the deregulation of our
economy.   Corporations that used to exist in splendid
government-given isolation are now turning up the advertising
heat to beat the competition - as seen in the slightly
hysterical ad Television One ran in the month before the launch
of TV3.  
    Made by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, it opened with a Steven
Spielberg-esque scenario.  
    A little boy put down his bicycle, spellbound by a
strange eminence in the sky - no, not ET in a spaceship but a
satellite-receiving dish feeding into TV1.   Set to a
piercing operatic score, the ad gathered breakneck speed,
touching down on the network 's superior points with the aid of
snappy editing and film techniques (hand-held cameras, shots
taken from the television screen).  
    The camera cut from a smirking Phillip Leishman to Liam
Jeory at Heathrow reporting on a fictional Air New Zealand
hijack and back to Richard Long fronting a shamelessly
sensationalist bit of simulated news.   The message?
  Viewers can rest assured that when their next-door
neighbours are held under siege under the sodium lights of
suburbia, Television One will be there to record it.  
    Saatchi and Saatchi managing director David Walden
describes the ad as challenging, instant, immediate and as
dynamic as television itself.   Preferring   his  
description (  "professional"  ) to mine
(  "slick"  ), he explained:     "People
don't sit down every night waiting for the next effort from
Saatchi and Saatchi.   They sit down to be informed and
entertained.   We 've got to try to reflect something of
Television One and do it in an entertaining
way."      
    But at least stylistic excess makes for fascinating
viewing.   And it 's a refreshing change from table-tops full
of happy families salivating over their rice risotto.   Or
all those baby-booming thirty somethingers doing up their
villas in between instant-coffee breaks.  
    Note: Today 's two-year-olds are tomorrow 's teenagers.
  Expect to see the teen market more heavily targetted in the
next 10 years as the offspring of the "baby-boom" generation
reach chocolate
  photos    caption  
bar-buying age.   Industry pundits are also predicting the
rise of the "empty-nesters": people in their 50s and 60s whose
children have grown up and moved out and who have high
disposable incomes to spend and (to quote one art director)
  "superannuation coming out their ears."    
    Right now, the major target market are white,
middle-class families.   But with one in three marriages
ending in divorce, how typical is the typical nuclear family?
  Full marks to Fernleaf for its brave, innovative ads
depicting a little girl visiting her newly separated father in
one ad, her mother in the other.   Families break up, times
change, but the quality of butter remains constant.   And
we 'll keep watching to see whether the couple get back
together again.   The brainchild of Saatchi 's creative
director, Roy Meares, he rates it as a personal favourite.  
      "Every time an ad breaks new ground it makes it
easier for others to take risks,"   he says of his
decision to forsake the traditional butter ad (Ellie Smith
whipping up scones in the kitchen) for gritty realism.
  By which he demonstrated the sort of unerring instinct for
a calculated risk that makes him one of the most creative
of the "creatives" (as copywriters and art directors are called
in the industry).  
    Once the target market has been pinpointed, an ad 's
script and concept is pre-tested and re-tested on
representative groups as it goes through the creative process.
  But according to Sue Worthington, senior copywriter at
Lintas New Zealand:     "You can research and plan, but
in the end a lot has to do with instinct: that 's what
ultimately separates a good advertising person from a bad
one."      
    It pays to check the target market 's instincts
against your own, however.   Sue 's colleague, art director
Allistair Elliott, relates the cautionary tale of an ad which
featured a male doctor sitting down to a meal of trim-fat meat.
  Pre-testing of the concept revealed that, unlike their
mothers, many women today don't trust doctors.   The ad could
have worked, maybe, with a woman doctor wielding the knife and
fork.   In the end, the whole idea was flagged away.  
    Once the content of the ad has been approved, no detail
is left to chance.   Everything you see has been chosen to
amplify the product 's image.  
    Take the series of television ads created by Lintas for
MORE magazine last year.  
    MORE 's marketing people wanted the ads to say "warm,
stylish and intelligent", in 30 seconds.   Once the right
model had been chosen to epitomise the MORE reader, the message
was orchestrated by every detail in her fictional living
room.  
  photos    caption  
  photos    caption  
    Sue explains:     "How did the room say warm,
stylish and intelligent?   It 's intelligent because
there 's a computer in it.   It was warm because it had a
lived-in look, full of articles that were very much 'hers'.
  Stylish, because she looked well-travelled.   The
articles were the sort of things she would pick up on overseas
travels.   We also chose a stylish, upmarket computer, but
made sure it looked userfriendly by sticking on those
little Post-It notes."     The computer spoke to MORE
readers in Ilona Rodgers 's voice (warm, intelligent).   Such
are the salient details at work to impress the innocent
television viewer.  
    There are various staple advertising styles that rarely
get aired in New Zealand ads.   Animation, for example,
because it 's extremely costly.   Likewise, Lotto-style big
production numbers with a cast of hundreds and extravagant,
tailor-made sets.   Few companies can afford to shoot their
ads in exotic locations (although Steinlager did it in print
with its   "They 're-drinking-our-beer-here"  
ads).  
    And we don't have an endless supply of genuine
celebrities on hand to endorse products.   Country Goodness
used socialite Judith Baragwanath and MP Trevor de Cleene to
endorse its cottage cheese, but usually, if you can't lure a
blue-collar Brit (Dennis Waterman) or an American action man
(Lee Majors) half way round the world, any New Zealand
sportsperson (or their mum) will do.  
    Wherever it 's appropriate, a New Zealand ad likes to be
a humorous ad.   Every night, couch
    potatos    potatoes     without remote control
are treated to a stream of jocular blokes, whingeing kids,
wacky housewives, funny faces and drop-dead parting shots
(memorably, in the ads promoting CER, when the Kiwi exporter
wheels a rack of gold and green cricket shirts past a
dumbstruck Aussie passport control officer.
    "Someone 's got to make your team look
good,"   smirks the Kiwi.)  
    In a decade dominated by business mergers and
acquisitions, advertising agencies underwent their own form of
regrouping, resulting in more complicated names (Hutcheson
Knowles Marinkovich - Rialto) and fewer real creative
opportunities.  
    Creative talent is hiving off, or being headhunted, to
Sydney.   Local agencies are being bought out by big
internationals, and the gloomier industry pundits predict
that soon we 'll be left with only two or three trail-blazingly
creative agencies, the rest becoming clearing houses for
ads made across the Tasman or imported from America.  
    It 's a notion that doesn't worry Roy Meares, whose own
agency, McKay King, merged with Saatchi and Saatchi this
year.  
        "There 'll always be clients who see the
value of importing ads so they can spend more money on media
[that is, buying spots on TV or radio or in print], but those
ads won't be tailored for New Zealanders and that 's what makes
an ad stand out."      
    So do humour and style.   So does sexism.   The
sheer awfulness of the Bluebird (  "the Hip
Chip"  ) ad, with a jeans-clad girl sauntering past
outstretched male hands, lodges the product in the mind.
  As does the supremely tacky ad for Rio underwear where the
female cop inexplicably whips off her skirt in the 
  photo    caption  
midst of handcuffing a crook.  
    Consumers, especially women, want ideas, not insults.
  Persil pulled it off with their scientist and his son in
the soap powder lab, a welcome departure from the cheery mum in
a laundry.   And soap powder has to be one of the hardest
products to push with panache: it 's unaspirational.   You
can't eat it or wear it.   The most it can do for your
lifestyle is keep it clean.  
    As for ageism, if the   Crofters'   Cakes granny on
a motorbike and the sweet old Mainland Cheese man are anything
to go by, perhaps that particular "ism" will be shown the back
door in the   '90s   as well.  
    Some critics blame advertising for altering
society.   But advertising people insist that ads don't
create social trends, they reflect them.   Far from being
flamboyantly creative, advertising is a conservative
industry involving careful research in the service of cautious
clients.  
    As John Sheridan, creative director of Auckland agency
Leo Burnett, says, you don't make good ads without good
clients.  
        "Advertising is always going to take the
middle ground.   It 's certainly not going to lead social
trends because it can't.   It 's essentially a group
business.   No single person makes a decision, and
whenever that happens there 's always a tendency for a
conservative decision to arise.   To some extent advertising
is about compromise.   And controls in advertising are far
more acute and absolute than controls on
television."      
    In a medium as pursuasive and pervasive as
advertising, perhaps there 's a case for a little judicious
tokenism here and there.   Maori and Polynesian people are
still noticeable by their absence on ads, unless it 's a plea
for hepatitis inoculation or the public spirited ads for
1990 showing Polynesian, Asian and European children hand in
hand or raising candles aloft.   Levene 's, Air New
Zealand and Telecom (again) are showing the way to go,
unobtrusively ensuring that good-looking, successful,
brown-skinned people take a turn in front of their cameras.
Writers like Sue Worthington at Lintas are keen to reflect New
Zealandness in their ads, a down-country, outdoor mateyness
ideally suited to mass market, snack food accounts like Eta
Ripples (the Indiana Jones-type hero traversing the length of
his speeding semi-trailer to get to his chip supply in the
back).  
      "Five years ago, clients would pay big money
for the BBC English voiceover,"   she says.
      "Nowadays, New Zealanders like themselves and a
lot more advertisers want to capture
    somthing    something     distinctly New
Zealand, like a person 's accent."      
    But we no longer live in a social incubator at the
bottom of the world from which a true New Zealand voice is
going to rise, Phoenix-like, from the ashes.  
    Any attempt at capturing New Zealandness in our ads is
bound to be an exercise in nostalgia, or a piece of
selfconscious myth mongering.   Like it or not, our
contemporary indigenous culture reflects the latest trends in
Los Angeles or London as much as the history of the people who
live here.   And advertising styles in the   '90s   will
inevitably follow suit.    
        ABORTION DEBATE - THE THIN RED
LINE    
      TIME WAS  , when abortion was regarded as
the big social issue of the   '70s  .   But here it comes
again, looming up as the issue of the   '90s  .  
    Abortion, as we all know, is a no-win debate.   Each
side has its entrenched attitudes.  
    One side centres its focus on the health and welfare of
women, making her interests paramount.   The other
believes just as ardently in the right of the foetus to be
allowed its own crack at health and welfare.  
    Two things happened late last year to bring the debate
into focus again.  
    One was the emergence of Operation Rescue teams, New
Zealand copycat groups who picked up on the rowdy way abortion
protests are being staged in the United States and decided to
try it here.  
      The other was the December 9 "guilty" verdict
brought against an 18-year-old Timaru man charged with causing
the death of an unborn child   "in such a manner that
he would have been guilty of murder if the child had become a
human being"  .  
    What happened was that Aaron Henderson and his girl
conceived a child.   Then they had a row and split up.
  Henderson exacted appalling revenge - kicking, punching and
beating his former girlfriend so badly that their six-month-old
foetus was later delivered stillborn.   That was what he
wanted.     "I don't want that baby born,"   he 'd
told the police.  
    The jury of eight women and four men were instructed by
Mr Justice Roper that they had to put aside any feelings of
sympathy, prejudice and ill-will in making their decision
over Henderson 's actions.  
    Henderson had not been charged with murder, he said,
because only a human being could be the victim of murder.
  And according to legal precedent, an unborn child was not a
human being.  
      "At what stage of the pregnancy would it become
an unborn child?   My direction to you on this point, as a
matter of law, is that you must be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that this child, at the time of the attack by the
accused, was capable of being born alive, having regard to the
medical evidence,"   said Mr Justice Roper.  
      "If you are not satisfied on that point, that 's
the end of the charge."    
    The jury was in no doubt.   Henderson, they said, was
guilty.  
    Which all puts an interesting new slant on the abortion
debate.  
    What, academically speaking, is the difference between
someone punching a woman in the abdomen to make sure a foetus
is born dead and pushing a tube inside her to suck it out and
bring about the same result?  
    Sure, the Timaru killing was committed with extreme
brutality.   But let 's not get confused here with the
injuries inflicted upon the mother - that, however
shocking, is not the issue here.  
    The other sort of killing (or "termination" to keep
things unemotional) is medical abortion, done coolly and calmly
and hygienically, in a clinic, after due deliberation and in
accordance with the law.  
    The Henderson affair happened because this
father-to-be decided he didn't want the baby to live.   Legal
abortions happen because the   mother   decides she
doesn't want the baby to live - due to a variety of pressures
and problems.  
    The Henderson assault was upon a child who 'd spent an
estimated 26 weeks in the womb.   With legal abortions,
termination usually happens when the unborn child has
got through only three months of development.  
    There 's no way a three-month foetus can survive outside
the womb.   Sometimes a six-month foetus can be saved,
but only with the utmost care and all the technology a modern
hospital can offer.  
    Where does this leave us?   With a law that says
(contrary to all scientific logic) that a foetus in early
development is   not   an unborn child?   That we
approve of the removal of such cell-growths in the early
stages, but that it 's not okay, in fact an awful crime, to do
away with it once it reaches a stage where medical science
  might   be able to keep it alive were it born
naturally?  
    Try to put aside your compassion over the beating meted
out to the pregnant mother in the Timaru case and consider
  logically   our attitudes over the status of the
unborn.   We 've got to face it - there 's a problem here&semi; one
that comes full circle back to the point the battling factions
have always been at loggerheads over.   That is, when does
"life" begin?  
    Does it begin at conception?   Religious arguments
over when the soul comes on to the scene can go on for ever.
  But, biologically, even the most pro-choice of us would
find it hard to argue convincingly that a foetus is
anything other than a developing human baby.  
    It ain't a pine tree or a turtle.  
    The next problem is to make up our minds whether it 's
right to do away with a developing baby at any point from
conception on - and if it is, upon what grounds it can be
justified.  
    Pro-choice advocates have
    aleady    already     firmed up their
viewpoints on that one - it 's the mother 's choice, they say.
  Her life.   Her body.   Her   right   to consider
the various legal grounds upon which she can seek abortion.
  Her   right   to decide.  
    Pro-life people still argue that we don't have that
right.   And the well-used mental-health grounds don't
impress people like Keith Wicks of SPUC.   "  Most
of the 10,000 abortions now being done every year are done for
mental health reasons.   What that 's saying is that 10,000
New Zealand women will go bonkers if they have a baby."  
  He doesn't believe it - he has more faith than that in
women 's resilience.  
    And if we are of the opinion as a society that it 's
illegal for Aaron Henderson to do what he did - that is, to
kill an unborn child (putting aside   how   he did it) -
isn't it illogical for us to say that it 's quite okay for
10,000 women a year to do it too?  
    There 's more.   If we decide an unborn child is only
a human when it 's old enough to survive outside the womb, then
how are we going to adapt our thinking on abortion to cope with
science 's ability to save ever-more premature infants?  
    Already, science is managing to keep alive 50% of
babies born as early as 24 weeks, or six months, of gestation.
  A few, only around 5%, can be saved at 23 weeks.   Yet
some abortions, under certain circumstances, are carried out as
late as 20 weeks.   The gap - that thin red line - is
narrow.  
    Watch out, in this new decade, for the gap to become
even narrower and for the arguments to become even hotter.
  Like it or not, the abortion argument still has a way to
go.   -   LINDSEY DAWSON        
  

          DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN AND
ECCE  ECCE=Early Childhood Care and Education        
    The Ritchies quote American research indicating that
for middle  -  class children, daycare made little
difference, but for the disadvantaged children, such as
those from the ghetto,    'daycare was of positive value
in language and cognitive development'  .  
    The Meade Report cites the benefits, based on an
American study at Ypsilanti, Michigan, that accrue to children
from disadvantaged families when they are given
  'worthwhile early care and education
experiences'  .  
    Young people who have had this experience are more
likely to complete their education, to seek tertiary
education, to be self-supporting - and conversely they are
less likely to be arrested or to have a teenage pregnancy.
  It was concluded that based on social costs saved, each
$100 spent at the pre-school stage would save $400 to $700 in
later costs.  
    The authors rightly note that not all pre-school
services will have this effect, since there were
   'structural'   features present in the American
pre-school.   It is unfortunate that these features were not
specified, since they are vital.  
    The researcher associated with this pre-school is Dr
David Weikart, who was invited to New Zealand to address
the 1987 Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education
as the keynote speaker.  
    In his address he made the following points (he was
talking about children from the age of two to five,
  not   infants): This is a time when a child moves from
the world of home as a toddler into an external world where he
relates with strange, big adults, strange peers.   There
must be a carefully constructed specific curriculum in order
to be effective.   Highly trained staff must be used (who
are likely to be university graduates) and there must be
on-going supervision and in-service training.   US$6
million had been put into the project.   This was a highly
funded, highly structured, sophisticated research
project.    
        SOCIAL BENEFITS OF ECCE      
    Contradictory claims of social benefits to be derived
from daycare on the one hand and home care on the other in
the pre-school phase are quite bewildering.  
    The Meade Report is adamant on the benefits.   The
Burns paper of 1988 acknowledges the dangers of increased
aggressive behaviour.   Dr Raymond Moore, an American early
childhood educationist and advocate of home teaching, likened
the consequences of grouping small children together and
expecting restrained and non-aggressive behaviour to taking
your dog down to the local dog pound and expecting time spent
with the pack to improve his behaviour.  
    Moore cited American psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner
and his team of Cornell University researchers, who identified
a    'social contagion'   as a result of too early
and too constant segregation with age peers.  
    It is questionable to claim, as the report does, that
self  -  confidence and trust and a deeper knowledge of a
child 's own identity are benefits to be found in early
childhood services.   Some studies have shown that children
who have been in daycare from one year of age exhibit
  more   dependent behaviour than children who have been
at home with their mothers.   Another study shows that
two-year-olds exhibited    'detachment-like'  
behaviour and three-year-olds displayed anxious, ambivalent
attachment behaviours when reunited with their mothers after
daycare.   Other studies conclude differently.   There is
a great deal of difference in the results of studies, and
enough variation so that virtually any hypothesis one cared to
pose that related to ECCE could be supported by legitimate and
high-quality research.   It is this uncertainty the working
party chose to ignore.  
    Ann Crane, president of the New Zealand Association of
Child Psychotherapists, had not read the newly released Meade
Report when I went to see her.   When she read the section
headed   'Myth 1: That it is bad for the child to be
separated from its mother'  , she was incredulous and
appalled.         `  You   can't   say when a
child can do without its mother.   You   can   say
that a young child 's best environment is with a "maternally
preoccupied person".   You cannot lump all pre-schoolers
together.   You have to be aware of all stages of infant
development and you can then make a wiser judgment of what the
infant can tolerate.
    `  You   can   say that for babies the
attachment, individuation and separation phases are absolutely
vital to accomplish.   We now know, quite concretely, that
you can't be sure of anything about the child 's readiness to
separate till about 36 months.
    '  We know that it 's better to introduce the
world in small doses to the baby.   We know that through
this maternally preoccupied person the baby learns to love, to
hate and to repair.   That has the most profound
implications for a peaceful society and for harmonious
marriages.   Take away the development of this ability and
what will be the consequences?
    '  We know that a mother doesn't have to be
perfect - just good enough.   What we are seeing here is
women destroying women - their own real power and strength.
  There are a number of child psychotherapists in New
Zealand who could write a report in contrast to this, only
we 're up to our eyebrows dealing with the consequences of the
placing of little value on childhood and of the failure of
systems to recognise individuality in
children.'      
    The Child Health Committee of the Board of Health
produced in 1987 a report entitled 'Parenting', by John
Williams, principal clinical psychologist for the Wellington
Hospital Board.   The psychological needs of children
include the following:   'Social relationships,
first in an intense form, with parents where there is an
experience of love and security which is continuing and
predictable&semi; then with other family members and ultimately
with peers and various members of the community.'    
    Eminent British psychiatrist D. W. Winnicott:
    'There is special significance in the devotion of
the ordinary good mother to her infant, the capacity for
eventual emotional maturity being founded as a result of
devotion.   Mass interference at this point in a society
would quickly and effectively lessen the democratic potential
of that society, just as it would diminish the richness of its
culture.'      
    The kibbutz (Israeli communal village) is often cited
in support of the socially beneficial results of communal
childcare.   But there are major differences.   There is a
well-developed kibbutz training scheme for care-givers.
  Child-rearing absorbs a major part of the kibbutz budget
and energy.   Most of the care-givers are fellow kibbutz
members and thus share an ideology with parents, resulting in
minimal inconsistency between home and daycare.  
    In a reassertion of the   parents'   traditional
role, most kibbutzim now have children sleeping at home with
their families.   Significantly, the pressure for this
move comes from the kibbutz-raised parent generation.   Even
during the hours in care, contact is maintained with
parents.   Breastfeeding mothers visit regularly and work a
shorter day.   Parents and grandparents are encouraged to
drop in.   Children are taken to see their parents at
work.  
    Kibbutz children, therefore, live in a child-centred,
socialist, village society.   While there may be lessons to
be learned in terms of staff training and curriculum content,
direct comparability in terms of the benefits or drawbacks of
daycare in an urban, individualistic setting is limited.
    Childcare in New Zealand   by Dr Anne Smith and Dr
David Swain provides a valuable New Zealand perspective on
kibbutz child-rearing.  
        ENHANCING OR REPLACING THE
FAMILY?      
    The Meade committee was required to take into account
the five principles underlying all government social policy
reform (none of which make specific reference to children).
  The last principle is   'enhancing the family unit
in New Zealand society'  .  
    The need most commonly articulated by people working
with families is the need for parents to receive education for
and support in parenting.   That will often mean support in
their own home.  
    The Meade Report is ambivalent about the family.
  Although it states that   'The family or whanau is
the main focus of early childhood care and
education'   and   'The primary responsibility for
young children lies with the family or whanau'  , it
later says that    'measures to assist families who
choose to provide all of their children 's care and education
themselves have not been considered'  .   This is
because   'the scope of our task focused primarily on
complementary care and education'  .  
    In 1977 Anne Meade, a sociologist who was then an
assistant research officer for the Department of Education,
wrote with regret of the resistance of the Playcentre and
kindergarten movements to providing daycare places,
because of the ideology of those movements that   'the
family should be the main socialisation agent until the child
starts school'  .  
    In 1988 Anne Meade, social policy adviser (education)
in the Prime Minister 's Department, convened the working group
that produced the Meade Report, which states:   'Early
childhood services are a modern invention to replace the
previous extended family ...'     A strange
interpretation indeed of the social policy goal -
  'enhancing the family unit in New Zealand
society'  .   It appears, rather, to be meeting the
goal of the Socialist Action League in its adoption of the
text 'The New Rise of Feminism' at its national conference in
Wellington in 1973:  
        'There is a much deeper understanding that
women can only be emancipated through deep-going social
changes, which remove from individual women the responsibility
for child-rearing and domestic work, placing this on society
as a whole ...
    '  The concept that society as a whole should
take the responsibility of caring for children is embodied
in the demand for government-financed, 24-hour,
community-controlled childcare centres ...   In addition,
this demand opens up the possibilities of   replacing the
family   institution ...   With its thrust against the
family institution, the women 's liberation movement is
profoundly revolutionary.'      
    A   'profoundly revolutionary'   approach
to childcare has been adopted, in essence, by the government
of a fairly conservative nation which has no idea that such a
profound shift has occurred.   Yet that shift has been
frequently signalled.   In 1984 incoming Labour Party
president Margaret Wilson said,   'As long as women are
seen as having primary responsibility for the personal care of
their children there seems little chance for substantial
change in the position of women.'    
        MARXIST FEMINISTS AND ECCE      
    In her history of the women 's movement in New Zealand,
  Up From Under  , feminist Marxist writer Christine
Dann wrote:   'Feminist energies were focused ... on ...
means of improving women 's income and status.     These
included better access to paid employment and to
childcare.  '     Dann relates the support given by
the women 's liberation movement to the unionisation of
childcare workers, who in 1982 formed the Early Childhood
  Workers'   Union.   However, as long as childcare is
still not freely available, provided by government and
employers, Dann says that childcare remains
  'unfinished business'   for the movement.  
    The economic basis of the argument for childcare is
seen more clearly when it is realised that it is a cause not
just of feminists but of Marxist feminists such as the
Christchurch Women 's Union, who, Dann reports,    'did a
survey of childcare needs in Aranui, a working-class suburb,
and produced a leaflet called "The Housewife and Her Labour
under Capitalism"'  .  
    The Working Women 's Alliance, another Marxist feminist
grouping, presented a   'Statement of Principle'  
which listed free childcare facilities as an essential item to
  'improve the position of working people in general and
women in particular'  .  
    This is entirely legitimate activity.   The
beneficiaries of the reform are clearly identified.   What
is questionable is the later procedure of re-casting the
legitimate economic concerns of women as an issue to benefit
children.   The editorial of the October 1988
  Broadsheet   (released at virtually the same time as
the Meade Report) asserts:   'It seems as if it will be
the job of feminists to go on calling for the liberation of
children to ensure that they do not remain isolated prisoners
in their little nuclear homes, and to continue the demands for
the recognition of alternative family
groupings.'    
        WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN CONFLICT      
    The section of the Meade Report headed   'Status
of Women and Women 's Changing Needs'   throws some light
on the philosophical underpinning of the report.  
    '    We consider that women should have the
right of choice and control over their lives.   Availability
of good-quality early childhood care and education
services is a basic requirement.   "Social policy for young
children makes very little difference to the role of men.
  It is women who in our society, as in many others, are
responsible for the care of children.   Measures to promote
the rights of children are frequently disguised ways of
controlling the role of women".   This statement is a
quotation from Dr Geraldine McDonald, now deputy director of
the New Zealand Council for Educational Research.  
    '    We see no reason why the needs of women and
children cannot be taken equally into account in the design
and funding of early childhood services - in the same way as
Maori cultural survival has been seen as of equal importance
to children 's needs within the te kohanga reo
movement.'      
    Indeed there is a note of rebuke in the report for
past governments which have allotted funding
  'based on the benefits that early childhood care and
education offers for   children   - and, in the case of
nga kohanga reo, what it offers for Maori cultural
survival.     The state has shown little interest in
the value of early childhood services for
  mothers   [my emphasis].   The establishment of the
Ministry of Women 's Affairs provides tangible evidence of this
government 's commitment to women 's participation in
economic and social life.   What is needed now is for
sufficient funds to be made available to early childhood care
and education for this to become possible.  '    
    This section concedes that the interests of women and
children may sometimes be in conflict.   It states a belief
that both needs can be met by the same device.   I believe
there is a conflict.   I don't believe both needs can easily
be equally met.   I don't believe there is much equality in
the means with which the cases are put.   One party has
language, maturity and power.   The other party has
  'no language but a cry'  .  
    We choose, very often, not to listen to that cry.
  Sometimes it is inaudible.   Children stop crying after
a while when their cries produce no response.   Very, very
few adults are investigating that silence.  
    Ann Crane, president of the New Zealand Child
  Psychotherapists'   Association, says,   'I
could go into any daycare centre in the city and find you
children who are in shock.'    
    Several needs are in conflict in the relationship
between children and their parents.   One is the need to
bring in sufficient income to maintain the family.   Another
is the need for a child to receive the care of competent
adults who love her or him.  
    My belief is that there is an inevitable conflict
between the need of women to live full lives in the workplace
and the need of young children to be looked after, at least
for the majority of their time, by somebody who is, as
Bronfenbrenner puts it, irrationally attached to them.   I
know of no very satisfactory way around the moral dilemma.
  But I do think it should be faced honestly.  
    Those conflicting needs have in the recent past been
met by sacrificing those of the mother to the child.   It is
now suggested that the child 's needs be sacrificed to those of
the mother (though the arrangement has been made more sanitary
by a skilful redefinition of the needs of the child).
  Neither solution is just, nor reflects the many truths:
&bullet;   That a baby or small child at home with a
contented and competent parent is in an ideal situation.
&bullet;   That children require stimulation, which
can sometimes best be obtained with other children in a small
group with a skilled, warm adult.
&bullet;   That pre-school children can benefit from
opportunities to socialise with other children in a secure
environment.
&bullet;   That for children in problem-beset homes,
good daycare can provide an environment of safety, stimulation
and benevolence that they would otherwise not know.  
    In a rational society there will be many choices
reflecting the many truths, and attempting to reconcile the
conflicting needs.   There will also be careful and
impartial research as a basis for policy.   It is
significant, for example, that the Christchurch child
development study revealed a low level of demand from mothers
for childcare services.   It further revealed that
  'for the majority of women in this cohort,
participation in the workforce was very much secondary to
their primary role of motherhood and
child  -  rearing'  .  
        TWO TRUTHS      
          '  I used daycare for my first child -
the best I could find, with a well-qualified owner/supervisor.
  The centre was quite well off for outdoor play space and
it was safety conscious.   But it was a long day for him and
I just felt guilty.   There was a high staff turnover, and
quite a brisk, impersonal sort of atmosphere.
    '  So with the second one I decided I 'd do it
differently.   I actually took a job in a daycare centre and
took her with me, but I really couldn't take it for too long.
  It was just too depressing.   Most of the other staff
were just girls, young kids who didn't know how to talk to
children, and really didn't know anything about them.
  Fairly inarticulate girls, so you can imagine there wasn't
a lot of talk.   The language of some of the kids, though,
was amazing!   I 'd never heard some of it before!
    `  At sleep-time the children had to sleep on
awful plastic platform things.   The sheets would always
fall off, so they were lying on those cold plastic things just
in their underwear.   I remember tears every time.
  '    So we left after a few weeks.   Now my
daughter goes to a superb kindergarten, which gives me about
three hours a day to work from home.   It 's not long enough
really, but I just need to look at the difference between them
- my elder one so much more tense and withdrawn, and the
younger one so outgoing and confident and happy, and I just
feel that daycare had a lot to do with the
difference.'      
    A two-year-old was eating a sandwich, inspecting
it after every bite, and admiring what shape she had made with
the remnant -  a snake, a moon.     'She picked that
up at daycare,'   said her mother.   She drew a
picture.     'That 's a rainbow,'   she said.
    'That 's from daycare,'   said her mother.
      'I haven't mentioned rainbows to
her.'       She sang a fantastic combination of
nursery rhymes with great joy.     'That 's from
daycare,'   said her mother.       'I can
never remember those things.'       She chattered
about various people.     'They 're her daycare
friends,'   said her mother.  
    The child attends this excellent university
cr&egrave;che for a few hours a week.   The rest of
the time is spent with her mother (including time at a parent
and child weekly play group) or with her father.  
      Complementary   care and education par
excellence.  
        ALTERNATIVES      
    There is an alternative to either immuring an unhappy
mother in her home or removing a child from his or hers.
  That is regarding a domestic dwelling as a workplace.
  The mother or father at home may well soon be receiving a
care-giver 's wage, as recommended by the Royal Commission
on Social Policy and endorsed by Dr Michael Cullen.   Why
should the home not also be the workplace of people hired to
care for the children?  
      A group of women in management have been lobbying
for home childcare to be tax deductible beyond the present
risible $200 a year.   A Cabinet Minister told them that the
Government did not want to create a Victorian class of home
servants.  
    Ombudsman Nadja Tollemache, former deputy dean of
Auckland University Law School and the mother of eight
children, believes that home childcare should be properly
paid,   'not under the table'  , and should be
regarded as important work.   Tax deductibility is important
for the employer and would enable a realistic pay rate.
  She does not favour the use of cr&egrave;ches.  
    Why is a private home less desirable as a workplace
than a factory is?   Is it the personal services that are
rendered that makes it Victorian servitude?   If that is so,
then what about the hospital wardsmaid or the hairdresser?  
    If parents prefer that their children stay home in
their own environment to be looked after by a substitute
care-giver, why should that arrangement be any less deserving
of government support, by means of tax deductibility, than
daycare centres are by means of direct grants?  
    Brian Easton, unique in New Zealand as an economist
who makes public statements about children, has recommended
that the Government give parents grants to look after their
children or give them tax deductions to pay other people to do
it.   He is opposed to direct state funding of childcare
centres because this does not give rights to the children.
  Easton states, however, that   'conceptually, the
grant should be to the children, not to the parents.
    The children "contract" with the parents to look after
them.  '    
    June Mariu, president of the Maori Women 's Welfare
League, says,   'The state should make it possible for
mothers to stay home and rear their children.'    
    Isolation of the care-giver and child can be a
problem.   However, the care-giver can also be
parent-substitute at kindergarten, playcentre, or at informal
play groups.  
    The absence of other adults to monitor the behaviour
of care-givers presents the same difficulty in this instance,
as it does with the 'family daycare' schemes, the backyard,
unlicensed, informal minder, or, indeed, the mother or father
at home with the child.   However, even formal daycare
centres with a number of adults on the staff can be dangerous
places for children, as several cases in the United States and
recently in Australia of sexual and physical abuse of children
in centres attest.  
    Early childhood care and training opportunities should
be available on the same basis to those who will work in the
home workplace as they are to prospective daycare centre
workers.  
    Helen May Cook, a childcare activist, wrote in
  Mind that Child  :   'During the early
child-rearing years women who work lead a rather crazed
existence, trying to manage by continually propping up a
system that never stays stable for very long.     The baby
gets sick, the centre closes down, the minder shifts away, the
hours of work change, the fees go up, there 's no after school
care...  '    
    She argues for   'a much broader look at the
structure of the workplace in relation to the domestic world
...     Several centuries ago the domestic and the
workplace were often joined together in the family unit, but
they are now firmly separated by miles of motorway,
impenetrable fences, age demarcation and rigid time schedules.
  So far the concentration has been on child-based solutions
where the workplace remains much the same and we arrange the
children according to its needs.   If our children are as
important as we say they are we should be looking towards
changes in the adult world.   For example, in many jobs the
presence of a worker at a desk in a communal space is not
necessary all the time.   Many people could work at home
for part of the time, with much less hassle and far more
productivity.  '    
    It is hard to see, in this age of computers, word
processors, facsimile machines, mobile telephones and
couriers, why a substantial number of parents, both male and
female, of young children could not work productively for at
least a part of their working week from home.   This is just
one of the strategies which, combined with job-sharing,
flexi-time and part-time work, could revolutionise life for
families with small children.  
      More   magazine investigated   'The
Great Childcare Dilemma'  , reporting on a successful
publishing venture based in four home workplaces where the
needs of parents, children and staff could be met.   These
ideas will not be widely used, not because they can't work but
because they are in conflict with what has become the
Establishment view, in which the new norm is: women
full  -  time in the workforce&semi; children in early
childhood services.

    Papakura District Court judge Ken Richardson
thought two years and 11 months was justice enough for Barry
Frederick Pompey, the unemployed truck driver who slaughtered
Pat   Evans'   family.  
    Pompey was driving drunk at 11 o'clock on a Sunday
morning when he tried to overtake at high speed on a blind
bend in South Auckland. Ron Evans (50) and his sons Craig (13)
and Robert (19) died as Pompey 's powerful ute smashed into
their little Toyota Starlet.  
    Pat Evans was told the news in her hospital bed, where
she was recovering from a disease which had forced the
amputation of her right leg.    
    Ron Evans was a man who wouldn't drink a beer at a
Christmas party.   He and his sons were killed by a man who
was so drunk it 's hard to imagine how he got the key in the
ignition.  
    Pat Evans feels she got rough justice from Judge
Richardson.   Incredibly, Pompey thinks he got rough justice
too.   He 's appealing against the sentence.

      After nearly   11 months in three
hospitals, Pat Evans (54) is finally home, in an echoing house
where she stays up till 2am with the photographs and other
memories of what was a happy family life.  
    She, her engineer husband Ron and first-born son
Robert came to New Zealand from the north of England in 1976.
  Craig was born here.   A year to the day before the
crash the family moved around the corner to a bigger house in
Weymouth, South Auckland.  
      "Who gets justice?"   she asks.  
        "I don't think ordinary folk get justice at
all.   He wasn't just speeding and knocking down a
lampstand you know.   You should have seen the shambles he
made of my husband, my boys, my car, my life.
    "  I don't think he should be fed three meals a
day and getting a choice of videos while I 'm struggling to get
a wheelchair ramp and someone to cut my grass.   Don't tell
me his hard-luck story.
    "  His sister approached me a week before the
sentencing.   I didn't need to see her.   Then his
solicitor approached me to ask if he could say in court that
he had made friends with the family.   It appeared
they 'd done it so it would look better in court.
    "  What could he do to repay me?   If he
came here and worked from dawn to dusk it wouldn't be
that"   - she snaps her fingers -   "of a
recompense.
    "  I wish you could have met my children.
  They were both in their top classes.   My eldest took
eight accounting papers at Manukau tech while holding
down a full-time job.   He had shares, he read the business
pages, he was a clever boy.   My youngest was a fortnight
off his 14th birthday.   That 's what I was giving to the
country and that 's what I had snatched off me.
    "  Our silver wedding anniversary was on October
10.   They were killed on the 29th.   I was looking
forward to the next 25 years.   I 'm not old enough to be
called a widow.   My husband and I worked hard.   We
wanted to grow old, watch our grandchildren.   Where will my
grandchildren come from now?"      
    Pat Evans is very angry and she has good reason to be.
  It 's not the anger of self-pity&semi; there is a great strength
within her that has somehow got her through the death of her
family on top of the loss of her leg.   A lot of her anger
is directed at a system which doesn't want to know about her.
      "I phoned the traffic department because I
wanted to make a statement, but I wanted to make sure it
wouldn't harm the court case.   You should have heard the
run-around I got.   I never found out what I wanted to
know."      
    From hospital she had no end of trouble finding when
and where Pompey would appear in court, even though the
1987 Victims of Offences Act requires that people in her
position be kept fully informed of the legal process.
  Nobody in authority told her the same law says the judge
could be given a victim impact report.   Her
sister-in-law, Cath Winship, who lives on Waiheke Island,
found out just before the sentencing, which was delayed
while a report was drafted.  
        "Do you know how I found out which court
it was in and when?   From that sister of his who came to
see me.   Otherwise I wouldn't have known."      
    There were enormous problems dealing with agencies
like Social Welfare and Accident Compensation which she
was fighting to get help from right up to Easter, when the
hospital suddenly told her to go home.  
    She had to battle to get even limited home help and a
temporary wheelchair ramp to use while she gets used to an
artificial leg.   Even when she got home she was still
arguing for help to get the lawns and gardens done.   Her
voice grows in fury as she describes how she got little action
until in desperation she phoned the office of her local MP,
Roger Douglas.  
        "I said to the charge nurse I needed help
to unpack, to dust.   The house had been empty for five
months.   She said,   'You can do that, it will give
you something to do.'     They didn't want to
know.   I wasn't asking for charity&semi; I 'm entitled to ACC, to
home help.
    "  I told them I was a sick lady needing
help.   They told me not to shout.   I had to do all the
arranging myself, I had to fight and shout.   I had to buy
throat lozenges I was so hoarse from shouting.
    "  I 've got no family&semi; I 'm left to come home to
an empty house.   I need help.   I don't need this flak.
  It would be easier to take a powder."      
      Barry Pompey   appeared for
sentence before Judge Richardson, the longest serving
district court judge in the country, on February 26, four
months after he destroyed the Evans family.   He was charged
with three counts of drink driving causing death.   He
pleaded guilty.  
    The offence carries a maximum penalty of five years in
jail, but a district court judge sitting alone - that is,
without a jury - only has the power to jail someone for three
years.   The judge considered sending Pompey to the High
Court, which could have given him the full sentence, but
decided to handle the case himself.  
    Judge Richardson sentenced Pompey to two years 11
months in jail - the maximum he was able less one month for
the time already spent in custody - and disqualified him from
driving for five years.   Not long ago it would have been a
heavy sentence but now it stands out because of its shortness
in comparison with other sentences around the same
time.  
    Approached and asked why he didn't send Pompey to the
High Court, Judge Richardson said:   "I can't discuss,
quite frankly, my reasons&semi; I 'm not in a situation where I can
do that.   I decided to keep it in the district court
jurisdiction, and that 's that."     He noted that
Pompey had   "gone to appeal against the severity of the
sentence."    
    Two days after Pompey was sentenced, Nicky Angelo
Carl Hei Hei was sentenced by Mr Justice Robertson in the High
Court at Auckland to a total of five years and three months
jail for a similar offence.  
    On November 24, Hei Hei had driven blind drunk onto
the Auckland Harbour Bridge at peak hour, spun out of control
and hit a car being driven by 23-year-old Anne Fleming.
  She died instantly.   Hei Hei 's wife, Teena Louise
Epiha (22), died the next day.  
    Hei Hei had pleaded guilty to 10 charges before Judge
Avinash Deobhakta in the Auckland District Court on
January 24.   Unlike what happened in Pompey 's case, the
judge declined jurisdiction and sent Hei Hei to the High
Court.  
    Both cases were controversial for another reason.
  Road safety campaigners have been demanding that
manslaughter charges be laid against drink-drive killers.
  The maximum penalty is then life.   Hei Hei was
initially charged with manslaughter but after plea
bargaining he agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges of
causing death while under the influence of alcohol.  
    Three weeks after Pompey and Hei Hei were jailed,
drink-drive killer Dion James Marsh was given seven years, the
longest jail term yet in such circumstances.  
    Marsh had killed 19-year-old Victoria Felton in an
Auckland suburb last year, moments after being booked for
drunk driving.   Inexplicably the traffic officer had let
Marsh keep his keys, enabling him to drive off and hit the car
the young woman was in.   Marsh pleaded guilty to
manslaughter.  
    The sentencing attracted a lot of publicity because
gang members menaced a television crew and members of the
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers group who were protesting
outside the court.  
      Two years   ago, Judge Deobhakta, the
man who dispatched Hei Hei to the High Court to get a longer
sentence, was singled out for unfavourable comment in
  Metro   magazine 's Court Jester section.   He had
sent Russell Henry Appleton to jail for 18 months for
killing a young couple, Paul and Sheryle Burrowes, on an
Auckland motorway.  
      "Although we are quite aware of the ferocity
of public opinion as far as drink-drivers are concerned, on
that occasion I may have made an error of judgement in not
paying due regard to the strong public opinion which has since
been perceived by me,"   says Judge Deobhakta slowly and
carefully, raising the court jester barb during an interview
for this report.  
        "On that occasion the reason I gave that
sentence was I was swayed by strong mitigating factors in
favour of the accused.   With hindsight and the knowledge I
have of the type of sentences which are handed down now, I
may have given him in the region of three years.
    "  When the public think that we are unaware of
public opinion, that is absolutely ludicrous and untrue.
  We are human beings, we read the papers, listen
  photo  
  caption  
to the radio, watch   Holmes   and we are quite
aware that the perception of the public through talkback is
that we are too soft.   I 've yet to come across anyone on
talkback who says we are too hard."      
    A lot of the public criticism in drink-drive cases is
really because of the charges being laid.   Judges only
decide the cases put before them.   It 's not their fault if
the prosecution charges a drunk driver with a lesser offence
than manslaughter, with the resulting lighter penalty.  
    But Judge Deobhakta says the prosecutor can also then
be unfairly criticised.       "I 've been a
prosecutor.   It is not always easy to pick up on one of the
most grievous offences to satisfy public opinion.
  Prosecutors have to make a value judgement whether they
can prove a case beyond reasonable doubt with the witnesses
they have.   If an experienced prosecutor comes to the
view he can not justify a charge of manslaughter, he would be
foolish to go ahead knowing the jury will not bring in a
conviction.
    "  0ne reason the Transport Act was amended for
the new charge of dangerous driving causing death with five
years jail was for the simple reason that, in the past, juries
were most reluctant to bring in a manslaughter verdict.
  Only with the public furore in recent years have jurors
been more ready to accept a verdict of manslaughter.
    "  If public opinion changes, judicial handling
of sentences changes too.   But we are not going to be
browbeaten by some minority lobbyist.   We have a duty to
the community at large.   How are we to know if the ones who
shout the loudest represent public opinion?   That comes
from research, statistics, value judgements.   If I were to
follow the view of every crank who rings Leighton Smith [an
Auckland radio talkback host], I would be totally wrong.
    "  It 's for Parliament to set the law.   If
the public thinks a maximum sentence is inadequate, it 's for
Parliament to change the sentence and say to the courts that
the previous penalty was inadequate."      
    Indeed, Parliament does this from time to time.
  Transport Minister Bill Jeffries has just announced plans
to make a manslaughter charge mandatory when drunk drivers
kill people.   This follows the campaigning by Mothers
Against Drunk Drivers, of which more later.  
      New Zealand   has more than 130 judges
in a distinct hierarchy.   The highest ranked is Chief
Justice Sir Thomas Eichelbaum, followed by the six judges of
the Court of Appeal, the 27 judges of the High Court and the
98 in the district courts.  
    These figures exclude temporary judges and those in
bodies like the Labour Court and the Maori Land Court.  
    The district courts are the busy   "people 's
courts"  .   They deal with all but the most serious
crimes by way of
  photos and captions  
 jury trials as well as a judge sitting alone, and they handle
civil disputes over sums up to $50,000.  
    The High Court tries the most serious crimes like
murder and rape, and handles big civil actions.   The Court
of Appeal deals with appeals from all the lower courts.
  Though the Privy Council in England remains the
ultimate appeal court, few cases go there and its
jurisdiction may soon be abolished.  
    Most judges work very hard for long
  photo  
  caption  
hours and are very well paid.   Sir Thomas Eichelbaum is
paid $175,000 a year plus $7800 in allowances.   Court of
Appeal president Sir Robin Cooke 's salary is $171,500 plus
$6400 allowances.   An ordinary Court of Appeal judge is
paid $162,000 plus $5500 allowances, while a High Court
judge gets $153,500 plus $5500 allowances.   Chief district
court judge Dame Silvia Cartwright is paid $143,000 plus
allowances of $4900, while an ordinary district court
judge gets $123,000 plus $4000 allowances.  
    By comparison the prime minister is paid $156,000 plus
$27,300 allowances, and cabinet ministers get $109,000 plus
allowances of $11,300.  
    Judges have arguably the securest employment
contracts in the country.   They can be removed only for
  "misbehaviour"   or inability to do the job,
and are in effect unsackable.   Their golden
superannuation package will keep them in great comfort in
their retirement, which must be by age 68 but can be earlier
if they wish.  
    Judges pay eight per cent of their salary into the
Government Superannuation Fund.   In return, on
retirement they get a pension of two thirds of their salary.
  They can retire after just 16 years with full pension
rights.   (Although the net pension will be reduced slightly
over the next nine years, in line with recent tax changes
which affect all public servants, judges still get one of the
most generous pensions, state or private, in the country.)  
    Some have retired early to get their super, which is
obviously very important to them.   In April, when the
  judges'   superannuation scheme was under government
threat, Sir Thomas Eichelbaum issued statements to
newspapers and went on radio, a highly unusual move.   Yet
when asked a few days earlier for an interview for this
report he wrote back saying flatly:   "Thank you for the
invitation but I do not wish to contribute to your
article."    
    There are tough judges, soft judges,
middle-of-the-road judges and judges who surprise everyone.
  Look at three judges who sit in the High Court at
Auckland.  
    If you 're convicted of a violent crime in Mr Justice
Sinclair 's courtroom you 're in real trouble.   He doesn't
pussyfoot around with liberal notions of rehabilitating crims.
  He jails them long and hard.  
    On May 19 last year Mr Justice Sinclair showed
judicial ingenuity when he jailed 18-year-old rapist Mark
Anthony Strickland for 15 years, a year longer than the
maximum penalty for the crime.   The judge achieved his
record sentence (three years earlier he 'd sent a budding gang
member away for 13 years for rape) by imposing two cumulative
jail terms, drawing applause from the police and the
law-and-order brigade and outraged howls from the liberals and
university criminologists.  
    The judicial opposite to Mr Justice Sinclair could be
Mr Justice Robertson, the judge whose resignation is most
demanded by National Party hardliner John Banks.  
    In May 1988, Mr Justice Robertson gave Michael
Morrison Herbert Retimana 4 1/2 years for a rape the judge
described as   "hideous"  .   The Crown went to
the Court of Appeal which doubled the sentence.   When he
jailed Maihi Tana in March last year for 6 1/2 years for rape,
the Court of Appeal raised it to nine years.   Some lawyers
suggest Mr Justice Robertson is hardening his attitudes
lately&semi; he was, after all, the judge who gave Hei Hei more
than five years.  
    Ted Thomas QC was a noted liberal and one of the
lawyers who stopped the 1985 All Black Tour of South Africa.
  When he became Mr Justice Thomas a few months ago he
quickly showed that a liberal on one side of the bench does
not necessarily a soft judge make.  
    In his first days on the bench, it was Mr Justice
Thomas who doled out that record seven year sentence for
drink-drive killing to Dion James Marsh.   In another case
he jailed Fale Satu for seven years simply for being a
passenger in a car from which someone else fired shots at
a police car.  
    Judges are part of society but they stand aloof from
it.   They rarely take part in public debate.   Although
an important part of the government process, they must
remain above politics.   The way they are chosen, appointed
and work is a mystery to most people.  
    Auckland University law school professor Bill Hodge
believes the judicial system needs more public scrutiny.
      "If I walked down the street questioning
people, how many could tell me the name of the chief justice?
  You wouldn't get one person in 10 who could tell me it 's
Tom Eichelbaum and nobody would know where he was
born."       He pauses.       "He was born
in Germany.
    "  When there 's an unpopular judicial decision,
nobody knows who to blame.   They just blame the courts
because nobody knows who the judges are.   I think it may be
time to have more public input into the selection of
judges."      
    Though Hodge is an American, he 's not suggesting New
Zealand adopt that country 's system.   Senior United States
judges are direct political appointments and some judges have
to run for office, facing such trials as being dumped by
voters for failing to impose the death penalty, as happened
recently in California.       "But there may be room
for a greater spotlight on the process
here."        
  

      OUR CHANGING FACE: GREYER AND
BROWNER    
      IF YOU SUBSCRIBE   to the Chaos
Theory, you 'll know that the only thing that 's certain is
that nothing is certain.   But there 's no harm in a little
idle speculation.   We can consult Nostradamus, crystal
balls or tarot cards - or we can start with something a
tad more scientific: demography, the study of population.  
      "Demography is of overwhelming
importance,"   says Ian Pool, sociology
professor and director of the Population Study Centre at
Waikato University.     "It drives the rest."  
In   The Business Of Population  , published by the
New Zealand Demographic Society, Pool and several other
demographers look at our future in some detail.   But the
latest word on the subject is   The Human Face Of New
Zealand   by a government committee on population
policy, which looks at our   "changing human
face"  .  
    The most salient features of our changing face?
  Wrinkles and grey hair.  
    Back in the halcyon days of the postwar baby boom, we
had a young, fast-growing population.   There was talk of
reaching four, even five million by the end of the century.
  But since then the birth rate has dropped away, dipping
below the   "replacement level"   of 2.1
births per woman (the theoretical run rate needed for an adult
population to replace itself entirely with another
generation).   By 2014, says   The Human Face  , it is
expected to have dropped again to 1.90 births per woman, so
there will no longer be as many ankle  -  biters coming
through.   Result: both a slowing in population growth and
an ageing population.  
    Our changing face is slightly more likely to be
female than male (about 107 females to every 100 males),
because women live longer on average.   And it will be
browner.  
    In 30   years'   time, nearly a quarter of us will
be of Maori or Pacific Island descent, up from 16 per cent
now.   By 2020 the combined Maori and Pacific Island
Polynesian total, currently around 550,000, looks set to top
the million mark.  
    We will become more multicultural.   With increasing
Asian as well as European and Pacific Island immigration,
intermarriage and "inter-ethnic mobility", we will have a
society - and a city - of more mixed ethnicity: something like
Brazil, Hawaii or Sydney.  
    Our average height - currently around 175 cm for men
and 164 cm for women - could increase slightly.   Overseas
studies have predicted average height increases of as much as
1.5 cm in the next decade, thanks to better nutrition and
improved health enjoyed by younger generations.   After this
though, the growth rate should taper off.  
    Changes in our average weight - 78.6 kilograms for
adult men and 65.4 kilograms for adult women - will depend
more on our eating and exercise habits.   The Hillary
Commission is currently overseeing an extensive "Life In New
Zealand" survey&semi; early results suggest   "there is no
evidence we are getting any thinner"  , according to
Barry Wilson, a senior lecturer in biomechanics at Otago
University.    
    Many of us still drink, smoke and eat too much and
exercise too little.   A recent survey for the Health
Department suggested a third of us are overweight or
obese, a quarter of us smoke, 58 per cent do no regular
exercise and 53 per cent drink at least once a week.  
    Our biggest killers are cardiovascular disease, which
accounts for nearly half of all deaths (coronary heart
disease, 27 per cent of deaths&semi; strokes, 10 per cent&semi; other
heart/circulatory diseases, nine per cent) - and cancer, 22
per cent.   Until we change our eating and exercise habits,
or they find the cure for cancer, we 'll keep dying in the same
old ways.  
    Due to general improvements in nutrition and
health care, though, we are starting to live slightly
longer.   Life expectancy at birth, currently around 71.1
years for men and 77.5 for women, is projected to increase to
76 and 83 for men and women respectively by 2051.  
    Even with net gains of up to 10,000 people a year from
migration, it will take us to between 2004 and 2009 to crack
four million.   The population could grow towards 4.5
million or beyond during the 2020s, but then, with the number
of deaths starting to exceed births, it could well begin to
decline again during the 2030s.   Only with gains of 10,000
or more migrants a year will the population continue to
climb, reaching 4.82 million by 2051.   (The number of
sheep, currently around 60.6 million, should pass 62
million by the turn of the century.)  
    A few more of us won't make a lot of difference,
though.   What will have the biggest effect on our lives and
lifestyles will be changes in the population 's age structure -
the number of people at a certain age at a certain time.
  Demographers call groups of people born in the same
era "cohorts".   They 're the most important ingredient
in the mix.  
    Until recently, says Pool, planning was driven by a
"growth ideology".   The philosophy during the
  '  60s and   '  70s was that we just had to do more
of the same thing - build more maternity hospitals, houses,
prefab classrooms - based on assumptions about baby boom
growth and high immigration.  
    It 's not that simple any more.   In the 1990s and
beyond, growth can no longer be the prime force - the
composition (by age, ethnic and geographical distribution) of
the population must be.  
    From now on the numbers of us in any cohort needing
child care, schools, jobs, hospitals, houses, cars, consumer
goods or pensions and the number available for the work force
at any one time will vary wildly from the previous or
following cohorts - creating headaches for the planners (a
shortage of classrooms one year, a surplus the next) and
having serious effects on our lives.  
      THE AGEING POPULATION   means we can
finally kiss goodbye to the old image of a young, fast-growing
country.   Welcome to New Zealand, the South Pacific 's
most scenic retirement village.   In the next 40 years the
number of aged will double.   By 2031, a quarter - or more
than a million - of us will be 60 or over, by 2051 nearly
a third of us.   By then 8.5 per cent will be over 80 (up
from 2.1 per cent now).   There will be more older women on
their own - because they live longer.  
    With increasing demand for retirement income, national
superannuation - already under threat because the
government says it 's costing too much - will continue to
be a thorny issue.  
    With the work force ageing and declining, there
will be fewer workers to provide for an increasing number of
beneficiaries, and more pressure on people to save for their
own retirement or contribute to private superannuation
schemes.   Many elderly will depend on their families for
support.  
    There will be a rush on rest homes, retirement
villages and granny flats.   Health services - both in
hospitals and in the community - will have to cope with
increasing numbers of frail elderly and terminally ill.
  For example, Alzheimer 's disease afflicts one in every
12 or 13 people over the age of 65, but one in every five or
six over 80, writes Janet Sceats, a medical demographer
with the Waikato Area Health Board, in   The Business Of
Population  .   Other prevalent health problems could
include anything from strokes to rheumatoid arthritis, broken
hips and incontinence.   Sooner or later most families
will be affected, Sceats predicts.  
    "Grey power" will affect all aspects of culture and
society.   Policies such as compulsory retirement at 65 are
likely to end, as more people approach that age in better
health wanting to work longer.   Being "ageist" will
become as much of a no-no as being racist or sexist.  
    In recreation, the trend will be away from high-energy
aerobics and jazzercise to more sedate fitness programmes for
older people.   Look out for lawn bowls and electronic
housie - they could be very big by the roaring
  '  20s.  
    And as the unusually large "bulge" of baby boomers -
which by sheer weight of numbers is the dominant consumer
force - marches through the middle years towards old age, the
social, political and cultural values of the day will change.
  The yuppies of the 1980s who clamoured for cars, mobile
phones, dinners at Cin Cin and FM rock will suddenly prefer to
eat at home and listen to the National Programme.
  Youth culture, which has dominated since the 1950s, will
no longer be fashionable.  
    For many it 's going to be tough.   The squeeze has
already started, says Janet Sceats, but it could really come
on during the next 20 to 30 years as we have to pay for more
and more services traditionally provided by the state -
tertiary education, health, and care of the aged.  
    And because of demographic shifts in the past few
decades (a move from late parenthood in the Depression and war
years to young parenting during the baby boom to today 's
pattern of delayed childbearing), some groups will be hit
much harder than others.  
    While some will have quite prolonged periods when the
dependency burden is low and disposable income high, says
Sceats, for many, caring for elderly parents could immediately
follow child  -  
  box  
rearing.   With the   "cold wind of user pays"  
already blowing through the health, education and social
welfare sectors, she warns, many New Zealanders   "will
barely have time to catch their breath before they start
facing... a retirement without the cushion of national
superannuation"  .  
      FOR OTHERS   - the large numbers of
unemployed, solo parents and other welfare beneficiaries -
it will be tougher still.   More than a quarter of New
Zealand children are now living in households where the
parents depend on social welfare benefits.  
    This welfare group, the underbelly of the baby boom
generation, has disproportionate numbers of Maori and
Pacific Islanders - particularly Maori.  
    Nearly 12 per cent of Maori adults are on the dole&semi;
one in every three Maori of working age and about 45 per cent
of Maori families are currently dependent on some kind of
benefit or accident compensation.   Maori are twice as
likely to be in solo parent families as Pakeha.   A recent
report on income maintenance suggested that a plan to cut
welfare benefits for single people living with others would
make one in every four Maori adults worse off.  
    With the lethal mix of unemployment, lower educational
achievement, teenage childbearing and solo parenthood, many
Maori could become entrenched into what academics call
  "multi-generation benefit dependency"  .  
    A vicious circle of unemployment, poverty and cultural
alienation could also lead to more crime, more young
offenders, more pressure on the penal system.  
      "When you enlarge the dispossessed and
unemployable class, the inevitable accompaniment is bigger
jails,"   says Auckland University political studies
lecturer Joe Atkinson.  
    Even if job prospects improve, the problem won't
go away.   Those disadvantaged now are likely to remain
disadvantaged.   Many of the long-term unemployed will
be Maori or Pacific Islanders, people with manual skills and
those who left school with no qualifications.   The problem,
notes Jacques Poot, a senior lecturer in economics at
Victoria University, in   The Business Of
Population  , is that manual jobs are getting scarcer
through the growth of the services sector and
technological change.  
    Unless these people, and the young (15 to 30-year-old)
unemployed Maori adults in particular, are "reskilled",
they could be outside the labour force for 40 years, warns
Pool.       "Unless they 're retrained, employed and
adequately housed, they 'll pass through life lacking not only
the skills and equity of their peers, but also of cohorts
ahead and behind them."      
    Auckland medical sociologist Peter Davis puts the
situation even more plainly:   "If the problems
facing the young and disadvantaged are not tackled soon, we 'll
end up with an underclass."    
    Maori will also be affected by   "massive shifts
in age composition"   due to a rapid decline in their
birth rate in the 1970s, say Pool and his colleague Nicholas
Pole, a senior research officer at the Ministry of Education,
in a New Zealand Demographic Society paper   The Maori
Population to 2011  .   There will be fewer young
Maori, but a bulge in late middle age and a tripling in the
numbers of elderly by 2011 - with corresponding increases in
health and welfare needs.  
    And the dilution of the ethnic group through
intermarriage and people changing their ethnic identity
could lead to possible problems of   "cultural
maintenance"   - particularly with regard to things like
kohanga reo and kura kaupapa Maori in schools.  
    The Treaty of Waitangi will continue to be the central
focus for Maori grievances, claims and aspirations during the
1990s.   Naida Pou, chairperson of the Auckland District
Maori Council, claims that   "the treaty is the only
thing that 's going to save us.     We 've the highest
numbers of at-risk people in the area of health, the highest
clientele in the prisons per head of population, the
highest numbers of dropouts from the education system and the
highest unemployed.   When are the other treaty partners
going to wake up to the fact that they 're
responsible?  "    
    Pacific Islanders, too, are worried.   Says Arthur
Anae, a Samoan businessman and entrepreneur:   "The rot
has already set in.     Most of our people are factory
floor people or freezing workers.   The government has
just put them into dole queues.   Our people are becoming
bludgers through no fault of their own.   Our kids are
coming out of school with nowhere to go.  "    
    Henny Fa'asalele, director of the Tagata Pasifika
Resources Development Trust, which runs Access programmes for
Pacific Islanders, admits that   "the future doesn't
seem particularly secure"  .  
    Nevertheless, both remain optimistic.   They believe
most Pacific Island immigrants are determined to succeed&semi;
that many will continue to do well in the professions,
business and government departments&semi; and that the strength
of the extended family and the community will preserve Pacific
Island languages and culture here.  
    Says Fa'asalele:   "We need to wean our people
off social welfare dependency.     We 're already starting
to see more community initiatives and Pacific Island
families moving into businesses traditionally run by
Europeans.   As long as a sense of family and community
remains, we 'll continue to aspire to great
things.  "    
      "By the year 2000, Pacific Island people will
be playing a very strong role in city councils and hopefully
in government,"   predicts Anae.  
      THE SHAPE   of the work force is
changing.   The number of working women is steadily
increasing - women already make up more than 70 per cent of
part-time workers and 35 per cent of full-timers, and could
soon outnumber men in part-time and full-time work
combined.  
    More women will take up careers in the professions and
more men will become involved in caring for children and
the elderly, says Janet Sceats.   There will be more
dual-career as well as dual-income families.   The trend
towards delayed parenthood will continue (last year 30 per
cent of births were to women aged between 30 and 39), and
instead of abandoning careers once they become mothers,
women will be more likely to return to work and spend some of
their pay on child care.  
    At the same time the work force will be ageing and
declining.   A big drop in the number of work-force entrants
will mean less pressure on employment but could have serious
effects on promotion opportunities, rejuvenation of the
work force and recruitment, and possibly, says Jacques
Poot, on innovation and progress in industry.  
    The sort of work we 'll be doing will change too.
  We 're still a trading nation - approximately one third of
our employment is related to the export or import of goods
and services - and we need to keep selling our goods and
services to highly competitive world markets, write Lesley
Haines and Paul Callister in the New Zealand Planning
Council 's   Tomorrow 's Skills  .   But those goods and
services, and those markets, are changing.  
    We 're moving more and more into an "information and
knowledge-based" society.   The sunrise industries are in
the service sector, providing "non-physical" goods and
services - tourism, communications, business services like
advertising, market research and design, and community
services such as health care and education.  
    While agriculture, manufacturing, and mining and fuels
accounted for 70 per cent of the value of our international
trade in 1988, by 2088 the service sector will make up nearly
two thirds, and the rest only 35 per cent.  
    The Planning Council forecasts a slow return to
economic growth in the early 1990s, with increasing exports.
  Some of it will be in the manufacturing and primary
sectors, but the service sector will lead the way.  
      The hot areas are business services and finance,
wholesale and retail trade, and the hospitality industry.
  The fastest growing occupations are managers,
statisticians, systems analysts, professional and
technical staff, economists and administrators&semi; while the
largest loss of jobs will be been among labourers and
construction workers.  
    The Planning Council predicts that by the end of the
century 70 per cent of jobs will be in the service sector, and
over 70 per cent of   all   jobs, in every sector, will
be non-manual.  
    Things we 'll need more of: communication and
language skills&semi; information, technology, number and
computer skills in the business and finance areas.
  Especially computer skills: the computer will become
indispensable everywhere - in shops, restaurants and every
sort of business.   Even in the home.  
    Haines and Callister predict higher levels of
self-employment and more small businesses.   So we 'll need
more entrepreneurial attitudes backed up by business and
management skills.  
    Just around the corner are increases in job-sharing,
temporary or contract work, more flexible hours, working two
part-time jobs instead of one full-time, and more people
working from home.  
    As is the four-day working week.   All those in
favour?  
      WE'RE STARTING   to wise up to some
new markets for our trade.   With globalisation of the
economy and industries operating on a worldwide basis, New
Zealand will have to do its best to fit in, says Auckland
University economics lecturer Robert Scollay.  
    With 3.38 million people we 're   "a small splash
in a large bucket"  , writes Warwick Neville, associate
professor of geography at Auckland University, in   The
Business Of Population  .   The world 's population
reached five billion in 1988 and is currently growing by
some 90 million people a year.   Most of the growth is in
the African, South American and Asian countries whose share of
the world 's population is pushing 80 per cent, and they are
producing a huge expanding adult population - and rapidly
expanding markets.  
    So as well as traditional trading partners like the
UK, and the Pacific rim countries of Australia, the US and
Japan (which will dominate the Pacific and be our most
important partner), rapidly growing Asian economies such
as Thailand will become increasingly important as markets and
sources of tourists, immigrants and investors.  
    Exporting to Europe and North America is hamstrung by
access restrictions, but those markets still offer
tremendous potential, says Wayne Cartwright, director of
the Graduate School of Business at Auckland University.
  The "triad" philosophy says that the USA, Japan and Europe
will be the big three - and once a united Europe gets going,
no power in the world will be able to stop it.  
    Following CER, inevitably there will be closer ties
with Australia.   The next step is economic union: there
have been calls for our tax laws to be harmonised, even for
the New Zealand and the Australian dollar to be made one
and the same.   The final step would be political union.  
      "Emotionally we say 'no way',"   says
Scollay.     "But logically, there are already a lot
of developments pointing in that direction.   It could be
seriously discussed in the next 10 or 20 years."    
    Adds Cartwright:   "The issue isn't
ourselves versus Australia but how are New Zealand and
Australia going to compete with the wealthy triad forces of
Europe, the USA and Japan?   There may be no option but
to get together just to survive."    
      TO BE INTERNATIONALLY   competitive in
anything, however, we first have to lift our base skills.
  We 're falling behind other countries in basic
communication, reasoning and number skills, say Haines and
Callister.  
    Compared to European countries, our school leavers are
not getting enough trade, technical or professional training.
  Nearly half our work force has no formal school
qualification, and 60 per cent has no tertiary
qualification.  
    Our youths leave the education system earlier than
those of other countries: of the OECD countries, only Greece
and Turkey have a smaller proportion in school at the age of
16.   And we have only half the level of participation in
tertiary education that the Canadian state of Ontario has,
for example.  
      "Compared with other developed countries we 've
failed miserably to keep our kids at secondary school and get
them into tertiary education.   In terms of the
technological needs of the 1990s we 're just not in a position
to be internationally competitive,"   says Ian Pool.  
      "Our current work force is ill-equipped for
the challenges of the new economy,"   add Haines and
Callister.  
    Pool warns:   "The European Community, North
America, Australia and parts of Asia could attract our young
skilled people.   How can New Zealand hope to compete
against the big players?   Our young people who are highly
skilled will do what young people who are highly skilled
always do - go overseas."   A lack of skilled people and
an ageing labour force are among the strong arguments
advanced for increasing immigration.   Business
heavyweights such as the Round Table and the Top Tier group
have long aired the view that a population of 3.38 million is
simply too small for any significant growth, and that we
should open the gates and pump up the population to five
million or more to get things moving.  
    The downside is that more immigrants would put serious
pressure on a labour market in which there is high
unemployment, on the environment, and on
  photo   
demand for services such as housing, health and education.  
    The government 's latest plan is to aim for a net gain
of 10,000 highly skilled people a year (rather than last
year 's net loss of over 6500) using a points system which will
weigh up potential   immigrants'   educational, trade and
work qualifications, family links, age, ability to settle
successfully here and command of English.   Where we used to
favour mainly European, particularly British, immigrants,
we are likely to see a lot more arrivals from South East
Asia.  
    There is a problem with this idea of
  "instant migration"  , says Pool.   It
assumes recruitment can be done quickly and competently.
  But in Hong Kong, for example, Canada and Australia are
recruiting much more efficiently and our immigration
procedures are amateurish by comparison.  
    It also assumes people are waiting to come here.
  That may not be true, says Pool, given that by the
mid-1990s there will be a shortage of young skilled workers
right across the developed countries.  
    Says Richard Bedford, professor of geography at
Waikato University:   "We 're a small country, with a
small economy, a long way from anywhere.   More Asians
choose to go to Canada and Australia... probably because they
believe there 's more opportunity in the larger industrial
economies."    
    And while bringing in immigrants could benefit the
main centres, particularly Auckland, says Bedford, it
won't necessarily do anything for the provinces or rural
areas.  
      "Just as many New Zealanders have drifted
north, most migrants will want to come to Auckland -
particularly the highly skilled, moneyed ones.   It 's
unrealistic to say that international migration will
have much effect on Southland or the West Coast.   If New
Zealanders are migrating out of those places, why should
overseas immigrants be attracted to them?"    
    A population of five or six million would double
Auckland 's population, says Bedford, and mean a shift to a
different style of city living from low density housing to
high rise.     "Do Aucklanders want that sort of
city?"   he asks.     "What about your way of
life, your environment?"
